# NAME

Tcl_RegisterConfig - procedures to register embedded configuration
information

# SYNOPSIS

    #include <tcl.h>

    void
    Tcl_RegisterConfig(interp, pkgName, configuration, valEncoding)

# ARGUMENTS

Refers to the interpreter the embedded configuration information is
registered for. Must not be NULL.

Contains the name of the package registering the embedded configuration
as ASCII string. This means that this information is in UTF-8 too. Must
not be NULL.

Refers to an array of Tcl_Config entries containing the information
embedded in the binary library. Must not be NULL. The end of the array
is signaled by either a key identical to NULL, or a key referring to the
empty string.

Contains the name of the encoding used to store the configuration values
as ASCII string. This means that this information is in UTF-8 too. Must
not be NULL.

# DESCRIPTION

The function described here has its base in TIP 59 and provides
extensions with support for the embedding of configuration information
into their binary library and the generation of a Tcl-level interface
for querying this information.

To embed configuration information into their binary library an
extension has to define a non-volatile array of Tcl_Config entries in
one if its source files and then call **Tcl_RegisterConfig** to register
that information.

**Tcl_RegisterConfig** takes four arguments; first, a reference to the
interpreter we are registering the information with, second, the name of
the package registering its configuration information, third, a pointer
to an array of structures, and fourth a string declaring the encoding
used by the configuration values.

The string *valEncoding* contains the name of an encoding known to Tcl.
All these names are use only characters in the ASCII subset of UTF-8 and
are thus implicitly in the UTF-8 encoding. It is expected that keys are
legible English text and therefore using the ASCII subset of UTF-8. In
other words, they are expected to be in UTF-8 too. The values associated
with the keys can be any string however. For these the contents of
*valEncoding* define which encoding was used to represent the characters
of the strings.

Each element of the *configuration* array refers to two strings
containing the key and the value associated with that key. The end of
the array is signaled by either an empty key or a key identical to NULL.
The function makes **no** copy of the *configuration* array. This means
that the caller has to make sure that the memory holding this array is
never released. This is the meaning behind the word **non-volatile**
used earlier. The easiest way to accomplish this is to define a global
static array of Tcl_Config entries. See the file in the sources of the
Tcl core for an example.

When called **Tcl_RegisterConfig** will

(1) create a namespace having the provided *pkgName*, if not yet
    existing.

(2) create the command **pkgconfig** in that namespace and link it to
    the provided information so that the keys from *configuration* and
    their associated values can be retrieved through calls to
    **pkgconfig**.

The command **pkgconfig** will provide two subcommands, **list** and
**get**:

> ::*pkgName*::**pkgconfig** list
>
> :   Returns a list containing the names of all defined keys.
>
> ::*pkgName*::**pkgconfig** get *key*
>
> :   Returns the configuration value associated with the specified
>     *key*.

# TCL_CONFIG

The **Tcl_Config** structure contains the following fields:

    typedef struct Tcl_Config {
        const char *key;
        const char *value;
    } Tcl_Config;
