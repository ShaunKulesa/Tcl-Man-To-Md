.TH Tcl_InitSubsystems 3 8.7 Tcl "Tcl Library Procedures"
.BS
.SH NAME
Tcl_InitSubsystems \- initialize the Tcl library.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tcl.h>\fR
.sp
const char *
\fBTcl_InitSubsystems\fR(\fIvoid\fR)
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBTcl_InitSubsystems\fR procedure initializes the Tcl
library. This procedure is typically invoked as the very
first thing in the application's main program.
.PP
The result of \fBTcl_InitSubsystems\fR is the full Tcl version with
build information (e.g., \fB9.0.0+abcdef...abcdef.gcc-1002\fR).
.PP
\fBTcl_InitSubsystems\fR is very similar in use to
\fBTcl_FindExecutable\fR. It can be used when Tcl is
used as utility library, no other encodings than utf-8,
iso8859-1 or utf-16 are used, and no interest exists in the
value of \fBinfo nameofexecutable\fR. The system encoding will not
be extracted from the environment, but falls back to utf-8.
.SH KEYWORDS
binary, executable file
