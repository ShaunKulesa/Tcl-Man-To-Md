.SH NAME
Tcl_SaveInterpState, Tcl_RestoreInterpState, Tcl_DiscardInterpState \- Save and restore the
state of an an interpreter.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tcl.h>\fR
.sp
Tcl_InterpState
\fBTcl_SaveInterpState\fR(\fIinterp, status\fR)
.sp
int
\fBTcl_RestoreInterpState\fR(\fIinterp, state\fR)
.sp
\fBTcl_DiscardInterpState\fR(\fIstate\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS Tcl_InterpState savedPtr
.AP Tcl_Interp *interp in
The interpreter for the operation.
.AP int status in
The return code for the state.
.AP Tcl_InterpState state in
A token for saved state.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These routines save the state of an interpreter before a call to a routine such
as \fBTcl_Eval\fR, and restore the state afterwards.
.PP
\fBTcl_SaveInterpState\fR saves the parts of \fIinterp\fR that comprise the
result of a script, including the resulting value, the return code passed as
\fIstatus\fR, and any options such as \fB\-errorinfo\fR and \fB\-errorcode\fR.
It returns a token for the saved state.  The interpreter result is not reset
and no interpreter state is changed.
.PP
\fBTcl_RestoreInterpState\fR restores the state indicated by \fIstate\fR and
returns the \fIstatus\fR originally passed in the corresponding call to
\fBTcl_SaveInterpState\fR.
.PP
If a saved state is not restored, \fBTcl_DiscardInterpState\fR must be called
to release it.  A token used to discard or restore state must not be used
again.
