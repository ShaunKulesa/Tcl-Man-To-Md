# DESCRIPTION

The following global variables are created and managed automatically by
the Tcl library. Except where noted below, these variables should
normally be treated as read-only by application-specific code and by
users.

**auto_path**

:   If set, then it must contain a valid Tcl list giving directories to
    search during auto-load operations (including for package index
    files when using the default **package unknown** handler). This
    variable is initialized during startup to contain, in order: the
    directories listed in the **TCLLIBPATH** environment variable, the
    directory named by the **tcl_library** global variable, the parent
    directory of **tcl_library**, the directories listed in the
    **tcl_pkgPath** variable. Additional locations to look for files and
    package indices should normally be added to this variable using
    **lappend**.

    Additional variables relating to package management exist. More
    details are listed in the **VARIABLES** section of the **library**
    manual page.

**env**

:   This variable is maintained by Tcl as an array whose elements are
    the environment variables for the process. Reading an element will
    return the value of the corresponding environment variable. Setting
    an element of the array will modify the corresponding environment
    variable or create a new one if it does not already exist. Unsetting
    an element of **env** will remove the corresponding environment
    variable. Changes to the **env** array will affect the environment
    passed to children by commands like **exec**. If the entire **env**
    array is unset then Tcl will stop monitoring **env** accesses and
    will not update environment variables.

    Under Windows, the environment variables PATH and COMSPEC in any
    capitalization are converted automatically to upper case. For
    instance, the PATH variable could be exported by the operating
    system as etc., causing otherwise simple Tcl code to have to support
    many special cases. All other environment variables inherited by Tcl
    are left unmodified. Setting an env array variable to blank is the
    same as unsetting it as this is the behavior of the underlying
    Windows OS. It should be noted that relying on an existing and empty
    environment variable will not work on Windows and is discouraged for
    cross-platform usage.

    The following elements of **env** are special to Tcl:

    **env(HOME)**

    :   This environment variable, if set, gives the location of the
        directory considered to be the current user\'s home directory,
        and to which a call of **cd** without arguments or with just as
        an argument will change into. Most platforms set this correctly
        by default; it does not normally need to be set by user code.

    **env(TCL_LIBRARY)**

    :   If set, then it specifies the location of the directory
        containing library scripts (the value of this variable will be
        assigned to the **tcl_library** variable and therefore returned
        by the command **info library**). If this variable is not set
        then a default value is used.

        Note that this environment variable should *not* normally be
        set.

    **env(TCLLIBPATH)**

    :   If set, then it must contain a valid Tcl list giving directories
        to search during auto-load operations. Directories must be
        specified in Tcl format, using as the path separator, regardless
        of platform. This variable is only used when initializing the
        **auto_path** variable.

    **env(TCL_TZ)**, **env(TZ)**

    :   These specify the default timezone used for parsing and
        formatting times and dates in the **clock** command. On many
        platforms, the TZ environment variable is set up by the
        operating system.

    **env(LC_ALL)**, **env(LC_MESSAGES)**, **env(LANG)**

    :   These environment variables are used by the **msgcat** package
        to determine what locale to format messages using.

    **env(TCL_INTERP_DEBUG_FRAME)**

    :   If existing, it has the same effect as running **interp debug**
        **{} -frame 1** as the very first command of each new Tcl
        interpreter.

**errorCode**

:   This variable holds the value of the **-errorcode** return option
    set by the most recent error that occurred in this interpreter. This
    list value represents additional information about the error in a
    form that is easy to process with programs. The first element of the
    list identifies a general class of errors, and determines the format
    of the rest of the list. The following formats for **-errorcode**
    return options are used by the Tcl core; individual applications may
    define additional formats.

    **ARITH*** code msg*

    :   This format is used when an arithmetic error occurs (e.g. an
        attempt to divide zero by zero in the **expr** command). *Code*
        identifies the precise error and *msg* provides a human-readable
        description of the error. *Code* will be either DIVZERO (for an
        attempt to divide by zero), DOMAIN (if an argument is outside
        the domain of a function, such as acos(-3)), IOVERFLOW (for
        integer overflow), OVERFLOW (for a floating-point overflow), or
        UNKNOWN (if the cause of the error cannot be determined).

        Detection of these errors depends in part on the underlying
        hardware and system libraries.

    **CHILDKILLED*** pid sigName msg*

    :   This format is used when a child process has been killed because
        of a signal. The *pid* element will be the process\'s identifier
        (in decimal). The *sigName* element will be the symbolic name of
        the signal that caused the process to terminate; it will be one
        of the names from the include file signal.h, such as
        **SIGPIPE**. The *msg* element will be a short human-readable
        message describing the signal, such as for **SIGPIPE**.

    **CHILDSTATUS*** pid code*

    :   This format is used when a child process has exited with a
        non-zero exit status. The *pid* element will be the process\'s
        identifier (in decimal) and the *code* element will be the exit
        code returned by the process (also in decimal).

    **CHILDSUSP*** pid sigName msg*

    :   This format is used when a child process has been suspended
        because of a signal. The *pid* element will be the process\'s
        identifier, in decimal. The *sigName* element will be the
        symbolic name of the signal that caused the process to suspend;
        this will be one of the names from the include file signal.h,
        such as **SIGTTIN**. The *msg* element will be a short
        human-readable message describing the signal, such as for
        **SIGTTIN**.

    **NONE**

    :   This format is used for errors where no additional information
        is available for an error besides the message returned with the
        error. In these cases the **-errorcode** return option will
        consist of a list containing a single element whose contents are
        **NONE**.

    **POSIX ***errName msg*

    :   If the first element is **POSIX**, then the error occurred
        during a POSIX kernel call. The *errName* element will contain
        the symbolic name of the error that occurred, such as
        **ENOENT**; this will be one of the values defined in the
        include file errno.h. The *msg* element will be a human-readable
        message corresponding to *errName*, such as for the **ENOENT**
        case.

    **TCL** \...

    :   Indicates some sort of problem generated in relation to Tcl
        itself, e.g. a failure to look up a channel or variable.

    To set the **-errorcode** return option, applications should use
    library procedures such as **Tcl_SetObjErrorCode**,
    **Tcl_SetReturnOptions**, and **Tcl_PosixError**, or they may invoke
    the **-errorcode** option of the **return** command. If none of
    these methods for setting the error code has been used, the Tcl
    interpreter will reset the variable to **NONE** after the next
    error.

**errorInfo**

:   This variable holds the value of the **-errorinfo** return option
    set by the most recent error that occurred in this interpreter. This
    string value will contain one or more lines identifying the Tcl
    commands and procedures that were being executed when the most
    recent error occurred. Its contents take the form of a stack trace
    showing the various nested Tcl commands that had been invoked at the
    time of the error.

**tcl_library**

:   This variable holds the name of a directory containing the system
    library of Tcl scripts, such as those used for auto-loading. The
    value of this variable is returned by the **info library** command.
    See the **library** manual entry for details of the facilities
    provided by the Tcl script library. Normally each application or
    package will have its own application-specific script library in
    addition to the Tcl script library; each application should set a
    global variable with a name like **\$***app***\_library** (where
    *app* is the application\'s name) to hold the network file name for
    that application\'s library directory. The initial value of
    **tcl_library** is set when an interpreter is created by searching
    several different directories until one is found that contains an
    appropriate Tcl startup script. If the **TCL_LIBRARY** environment
    variable exists, then the directory it names is checked first. If
    **TCL_LIBRARY** is not set or doesn\'t refer to an appropriate
    directory, then Tcl checks several other directories based on a
    compiled-in default location, the location of the binary containing
    the application, and the current working directory.

**tcl_patchLevel**

:   When an interpreter is created Tcl initializes this variable to hold
    a string giving the current patch level for Tcl, such as **8.4.16**
    for Tcl 8.4 with the first sixteen official patches, or **8.5b3**
    for the third beta release of Tcl 8.5. The value of this variable is
    returned by the **info patchlevel** command.

**tcl_pkgPath**

:   This variable holds a list of directories indicating where packages
    are normally installed. It is not used on Windows. It typically
    contains either one or two entries; if it contains two entries, the
    first is normally a directory for platform-dependent packages (e.g.,
    shared library binaries) and the second is normally a directory for
    platform-independent packages (e.g., script files). Typically a
    package is installed as a subdirectory of one of the entries in the
    **tcl_pkgPath** variable. The directories in the **tcl_pkgPath**
    variable are included by default in the **auto_path** variable, so
    they and their immediate subdirectories are automatically searched
    for packages during **package require** commands. Note:
    **tcl_pkgPath** is not intended to be modified by the application.
    Its value is added to **auto_path** at startup; changes to
    **tcl_pkgPath** are not reflected in **auto_path**. If you want Tcl
    to search additional directories for packages you should add the
    names of those directories to **auto_path**, not **tcl_pkgPath**.

**tcl_platform**

:   This is an associative array whose elements contain information
    about the platform on which the application is running, such as the
    name of the operating system, its current release number, and the
    machine\'s instruction set. The elements listed below will always be
    defined, but they may have empty strings as values if Tcl could not
    retrieve any relevant information. In addition, extensions and
    applications may add additional values to the array. The predefined
    elements are:

    **byteOrder**

    :   The native byte order of this machine: either **littleEndian**
        or **bigEndian**.

    **debug**

    :   If this variable exists, then the interpreter was compiled with
        and linked to a debug-enabled C run-time. This variable will
        only exist on Windows, so extension writers can specify which
        package to load depending on the C run-time library that is in
        use. This is not an indication that this core contains symbols.

    **engine**

    :   The name of the Tcl language implementation. When the
        interpreter is first created, this is always set to the string
        **Tcl**.

    **machine**

    :   The instruction set executed by this machine, such as **intel**,
        **PPC**, **68k**, or **sun4m**. On UNIX machines, this is the
        value returned by **uname -m**.

    **os**

    :   The name of the operating system running on this machine, such
        as **Windows NT** or **SunOS**. On UNIX machines, this is the
        value returned by **uname -s**.

    **osVersion**

    :   The version number for the operating system running on this
        machine. On UNIX machines, this is the value returned by **uname
        -r**.

    **pathSeparator**

    :   

    The character that should be used to **split** PATH-like environment
    variables into their corresponding list of directory names.

    **platform**

    :   Either **windows**, or **unix**. This identifies the general
        operating environment of the machine.

    **pointerSize**

    :   This gives the size of the native-machine pointer in bytes
        (strictly, it is same as the result of evaluating
        *sizeof(void\*)* in C.)

    **threaded**

    :   If this variable exists, then the interpreter was compiled with
        threads enabled.

    **user**

    :   This identifies the current user based on the login information
        available on the platform. This value comes from the getuid()
        and getpwuid() system calls on Unix, and the value from the
        GetUserName() system call on Windows.

    **wordSize**

    :   This gives the size of the native-machine word in bytes
        (strictly, it is same as the result of evaluating *sizeof(long)*
        in C.)

**tcl_precision**

:   This variable controls the number of digits to generate when
    converting floating-point values to strings. It defaults to 0.
    *Applications should not change this value;* it is provided for
    compatibility with legacy code.

> The default value of 0 is special, meaning that Tcl should convert
> numbers using as few digits as possible while still distinguishing any
> floating point number from its nearest neighbours. It differs from
> using an arbitrarily high value for *tcl_precision* in that an inexact
> number like *1.4* will convert as *1.4* rather than
> *1.3999999999999999* even though the latter is nearer to the exact
> value of the binary number.

> If **tcl_precision** is not zero, then when Tcl converts a floating
> point number, it creates a decimal representation of at most
> **tcl_precision** significant digits; the result may be shorter if the
> shorter result represents the original number exactly. If no result of
> at most **tcl_precision** digits is an exact representation of the
> original number, the one that is closest to the original number is
> chosen. If the original number lies precisely between two equally
> accurate decimal representations, then the one with an even value for
> the least significant digit is chosen; for instance, if
> **tcl_precision** is 3, then 0.3125 will convert to 0.312, not 0.313,
> while 0.6875 will convert to 0.688, not 0.687. Any string of trailing
> zeroes that remains is trimmed.

> a **tcl_precision** value of 17 digits is for IEEE floating-point in
> that it allows double-precision values to be converted to strings and
> back to binary with no loss of information. For this reason, you will
> often see it as a value in legacy code that must run on Tcl versions
> before 8.5. It is no longer recommended; as noted above, a zero value
> is the preferred method.

> All interpreters in a thread share a single **tcl_precision** value:
> changing it in one interpreter will affect all other interpreters as
> well. Safe interpreters are not allowed to modify the variable.

> Valid values for **tcl_precision** range from 0 to 17.

**tcl_rcFileName**

:   This variable is used during initialization to indicate the name of
    a user-specific startup file. If it is set by application-specific
    initialization, then the Tcl startup code will check for the
    existence of this file and **source** it if it exists. For example,
    for **wish** the variable is set to **\~/.wishrc** for Unix and
    **\~/wishrc.tcl** for Windows.

**tcl_traceCompile**

:   The value of this variable can be set to control how much tracing
    information is displayed during bytecode compilation. By default,
    **tcl_traceCompile** is zero and no information is displayed.
    Setting **tcl_traceCompile** to 1 generates a one-line summary in
    **stdout** whenever a procedure or top-level command is compiled.
    Setting it to 2 generates a detailed listing in **stdout** of the
    bytecode instructions emitted during every compilation. This
    variable is useful in tracking down suspected problems with the Tcl
    compiler.

> This variable and functionality only exist if **TCL_COMPILE_DEBUG**
> was defined during Tcl\'s compilation.

**tcl_traceExec**

:   The value of this variable can be set to control how much tracing
    information is displayed during bytecode execution. By default,
    **tcl_traceExec** is zero and no information is displayed. Setting
    **tcl_traceExec** to 1 generates a one-line trace in **stdout** on
    each call to a Tcl procedure. Setting it to 2 generates a line of
    output whenever any Tcl command is invoked that contains the name of
    the command and its arguments. Setting it to 3 produces a detailed
    trace showing the result of executing each bytecode instruction.
    Note that when **tcl_traceExec** is 2 or 3, commands such as **set**
    and **incr** that have been entirely replaced by a sequence of
    bytecode instructions are not shown. Setting this variable is useful
    in tracking down suspected problems with the bytecode compiler and
    interpreter.

> This variable and functionality only exist if **TCL_COMPILE_DEBUG**
> was defined during Tcl\'s compilation.

**tcl_wordchars**

:   The value of this variable is a regular expression that can be set
    to control what are considered characters, for instances like
    selecting a word by double-clicking in text in Tk. It is platform
    dependent. On Windows, it defaults to **\\S**, meaning anything but
    a Unicode space character. Otherwise it defaults to **\\w**, which
    is any Unicode word character (number, letter, or underscore).

**tcl_nonwordchars**

:   The value of this variable is a regular expression that can be set
    to control what are considered characters, for instances like
    selecting a word by double-clicking in text in Tk. It is platform
    dependent. On Windows, it defaults to **\\s**, meaning any Unicode
    space character. Otherwise it defaults to **\\W**, which is anything
    but a Unicode word character (number, letter, or underscore).

**tcl_version**

:   When an interpreter is created Tcl initializes this variable to hold
    the version number for this version of Tcl in the form *x.y*.
    Changes to *x* represent major changes with probable
    incompatibilities and changes to *y* represent small enhancements
    and bug fixes that retain backward compatibility. The value of this
    variable is returned by the **info tclversion** command.

# OTHER GLOBAL VARIABLES

The following variables are only guaranteed to exist in **tclsh** and
**wish** executables; the Tcl library does not define them itself but
many Tcl environments do.

**argc**

:   The number of arguments to **tclsh** or **wish**.

**argv**

:   Tcl list of arguments to **tclsh** or **wish**.

**argv0**

:   The script that **tclsh** or **wish** started executing (if it was
    specified) or otherwise the name by which **tclsh** or **wish** was
    invoked.

**tcl_interactive**

:   Contains 1 if **tclsh** or **wish** is running interactively (no
    script was specified and standard input is a terminal-like device),
    0 otherwise.

# EXAMPLES

To add a directory to the collection of locations searched by **package
require**, e.g., because of some application-specific packages that are
used, the **auto_path** variable needs to be updated:

    lappend ::auto_path [file join [pwd] "theLibDir"]

A simple though not very robust way to handle command line arguments of
the form is to load them into an array having first loaded in the
default settings:

    array set arguments {-foo 0 -bar 0 -grill 0}
    array set arguments $::argv
    puts "foo is $arguments(-foo)"
    puts "bar is $arguments(-bar)"
    puts "grill is $arguments(-grill)"

The **argv0** global variable can be used (in conjunction with the
**info script** command) to determine whether the current script is
being executed as the main script or loaded as a library. This is useful
because it allows a single script to be used as both a library and a
demonstration of that library:

    if {$::argv0 eq [info script]} {
        # running as: tclsh example.tcl
    } else {
        package provide Example 1.0
    }
