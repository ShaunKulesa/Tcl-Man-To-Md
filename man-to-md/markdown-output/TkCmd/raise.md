# NAME

raise - Change a window\'s position in the stacking order

# SYNOPSIS

**raise ***window *?*aboveThis*?

# DESCRIPTION

If the *aboveThis* argument is omitted then the command raises *window*
so that it is above all of its siblings in the stacking order (it will
not be obscured by any siblings and will obscure any siblings that
overlap it). If *aboveThis* is specified then it must be the path name
of a window that is either a sibling of *window* or the descendant of a
sibling of *window*. In this case the **raise** command will insert
*window* into the stacking order just above *aboveThis* (or the ancestor
of *aboveThis* that is a sibling of *window*); this could end up either
raising or lowering *window*.

All **toplevel** windows may be restacked with respect to each other,
whatever their relative path names, but the window manager is not
obligated to strictly honor requests to restack.

On macOS raising an iconified **toplevel** window causes it to be
deiconified.

# EXAMPLE

Make a button appear to be in a sibling frame that was created after it.
This is is often necessary when building GUIs in the style where you
create your activity widgets first before laying them out on the
display:

    button .b -text "Hi there!"
    pack [frame .f -background blue]
    pack [label .f.l1 -text "This is above"]
    pack .b -in .f
    pack [label .f.l2 -text "This is below"]
    raise .b
