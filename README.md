# Tcl-Man-To-Md

## What is the aim?

The aim of this is it to convert the man pages written in nroff to markdown which is a modern and universal solution for everyone.

From that point onwards the man pages will then be edited by the community as markdown. This opens up a bigger opportunity as the markdown can be converted back to nroff for those who need it or it can be converted to plain html.

This also allows us to use software such as mkdocs to convert the markdown into a modern looking documentation.
