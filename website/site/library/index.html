<h1 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>Tcl includes a library of Tcl procedures for commonly-needed functions.
The procedures defined in the Tcl library are generic ones suitable for
use by many different applications. The location of the Tcl library is
returned by the <strong>info library</strong> command. In addition to the Tcl
library, each application will normally have its own library of support
procedures as well; the location of this library is normally given by
the value of the <strong>\$</strong><em>app</em><strong>_library</strong> global variable, where <em>app</em>
is the name of the application. For example, the location of the Tk
library is kept in the variable <strong>tk_library</strong>.</p>
<p>To access the procedures in the Tcl library, an application should
source the file <strong>init.tcl</strong> in the library, for example with the Tcl
command</p>
<p><strong>source [file join [info library] init.tcl]</strong></p>
<p>If the library procedure <strong>Tcl_Init</strong> is invoked from an application\'s
<strong>Tcl_AppInit</strong> procedure, this happens automatically. The code in
<strong>init.tcl</strong> will define the <strong>unknown</strong> procedure and arrange for the
other procedures to be loaded on-demand using the auto-load mechanism
defined below.</p>
<h1 id="command-procedures">COMMAND PROCEDURES</h1>
<p>The following procedures are provided in the Tcl library:</p>
<p><strong>auto_execok </strong><em>cmd</em></p>
<p>:   Determines whether there is an executable file or shell builtin by
    the name <em>cmd</em>. If so, it returns a list of arguments to be passed
    to <strong>exec</strong> to execute the executable file or shell builtin named by
    <em>cmd</em>. If not, it returns an empty string. This command examines the
    directories in the current search path (given by the PATH
    environment variable) in its search for an executable file named
    <em>cmd</em>. On Windows platforms, the search is expanded with the same
    directories and file extensions as used by <strong>exec</strong>. <strong>Auto_execok</strong>
    remembers information about previous searches in an array named
    <strong>auto_execs</strong>; this avoids the path search in future calls for the
    same <em>cmd</em>. The command <strong>auto_reset</strong> may be used to force
    <strong>auto_execok</strong> to forget its cached information.</p>
<p><strong>auto_import </strong><em>pattern</em></p>
<p>:   <strong>Auto_import</strong> is invoked during <strong>namespace import</strong> to see if the
    imported commands specified by <em>pattern</em> reside in an autoloaded
    library. If so, the commands are loaded so that they will be
    available to the interpreter for creating the import links. If the
    commands do not reside in an autoloaded library, <strong>auto_import</strong>
    does nothing. The pattern matching is performed according to the
    matching rules of <strong>namespace import</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>auto_load </strong><em>cmd</em></p>
<p>:   This command attempts to load the definition for a Tcl command named
    <em>cmd</em>. To do this, it searches an <em>auto-load path</em>, which is a list
    of one or more directories. The auto-load path is given by the
    global variable <strong>auto_path</strong> if it exists. If there is no
    <strong>auto_path</strong> variable, then the TCLLIBPATH environment variable is
    used, if it exists. Otherwise the auto-load path consists of just
    the Tcl library directory. Within each directory in the auto-load
    path there must be a file <strong>tclIndex</strong> that describes one or more
    commands defined in that directory and a script to evaluate to load
    each of the commands. The <strong>tclIndex</strong> file should be generated with
    the <strong>auto_mkindex</strong> command. If <em>cmd</em> is found in an index file,
    then the appropriate script is evaluated to create the command. The
    <strong>auto_load</strong> command returns 1 if <em>cmd</em> was successfully created.
    The command returns 0 if there was no index entry for <em>cmd</em> or if
    the script did not actually define <em>cmd</em> (e.g. because index
    information is out of date). If an error occurs while processing the
    script, then that error is returned. <strong>Auto_load</strong> only reads the
    index information once and saves it in the array <strong>auto_index</strong>;
    future calls to <strong>auto_load</strong> check for <em>cmd</em> in the array rather
    than re-reading the index files. The cached index information may be
    deleted with the command <strong>auto_reset</strong>. This will force the next
    <strong>auto_load</strong> command to reload the index database from disk.</p>
<p><strong>auto_mkindex </strong><em>dir pattern pattern ...</em></p>
<p>:   Generates an index suitable for use by <strong>auto_load</strong>. The command
    searches <em>dir</em> for all files whose names match any of the <em>pattern</em>
    arguments (matching is done with the <strong>glob</strong> command), generates an
    index of all the Tcl command procedures defined in all the matching
    files, and stores the index information in a file named <strong>tclIndex</strong>
    in <em>dir</em>. If no pattern is given a pattern of <strong>*.tcl</strong> will be
    assumed. For example, the command</p>
<pre><code>**auto_mkindex foo \*.tcl**

will read all the **.tcl** files in subdirectory **foo** and
generate a new index file **foo/tclIndex**.

**Auto_mkindex** parses the Tcl scripts by sourcing them into a
child interpreter and monitoring the proc and namespace commands
that are executed. Extensions can use the (undocumented)
auto_mkindex_parser package to register other commands that can
contribute to the auto_load index. You will have to read through
auto.tcl to see how this works.

**Auto_mkindex_old** (which has the same syntax as **auto_mkindex**)
parses the Tcl scripts in a relatively unsophisticated way: if any
line contains the word

as its first characters then it is assumed to be a procedure
definition and the next word of the line is taken as the
procedure\'s name. Procedure definitions that do not appear in this
way (e.g. they have spaces before the **proc**) will not be indexed.
If your script contains

code, such as global initialization code or procedure names with
special characters like **\$**, **\***, **\[** or **\]**, you are
safer using **auto_mkindex_old**.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>auto_reset</strong></p>
<p>:   Destroys all the information cached by <strong>auto_execok</strong> and
    <strong>auto_load</strong>. This information will be re-read from disk the next
    time it is needed. <strong>Auto_reset</strong> also deletes any procedures listed
    in the auto-load index, so that fresh copies of them will be loaded
    the next time that they are used.</p>
<p><strong>auto_qualify </strong><em>command namespace</em></p>
<p>:   Computes a list of fully qualified names for <em>command</em>. This list
    mirrors the path a standard Tcl interpreter follows for command
    lookups: first it looks for the command in the current namespace,
    and then in the global namespace. Accordingly, if <em>command</em> is
    relative and <em>namespace</em> is not <strong>::</strong>, the list returned has two
    elements: <em>command</em> scoped by <em>namespace</em>, as if it were a command
    in the <em>namespace</em> namespace; and <em>command</em> as if it were a command
    in the global namespace. Otherwise, if either <em>command</em> is absolute
    (it begins with <strong>::</strong>), or <em>namespace</em> is <strong>::</strong>, the list contains
    only <em>command</em> as if it were a command in the global namespace.</p>
<pre><code>**Auto_qualify** is used by the auto-loading facilities in Tcl, both
for producing auto-loading indexes such as *pkgIndex.tcl*, and for
performing the actual auto-loading of functions at runtime.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>tcl_findLibrary </strong><em>basename version patch initScript enVarName varName</em></p>
<p>:   This is a standard search procedure for use by extensions during
    their initialization. They call this procedure to look for their
    script library in several standard directories. The last component
    of the name of the library directory is normally <em>basenameversion</em>
    (e.g., tk8.0), but it might be</p>
<p>when in the build hierarchies. The <em>initScript</em> file will be sourced
into the interpreter once it is found. The directory in which this file
is found is stored into the global variable <em>varName</em>. If this variable
is already defined (e.g., by C code during application initialization)
then no searching is done. Otherwise the search looks in these
directories: the directory named by the environment variable
<em>enVarName</em>; relative to the Tcl library directory; relative to the
executable file in the standard installation bin or bin/<em>arch</em>
directory; relative to the executable file in the current build tree;
relative to the executable file in a parallel build tree.</p>
<p><strong>parray </strong><em>arrayName</em> ?<em>pattern</em>?</p>
<p>:   Prints on standard output the names and values of all the elements
    in the array <em>arrayName</em>, or just the names that match <em>pattern</em>
    (using the matching rules of <strong>string match</strong>) and their values if
    <em>pattern</em> is given. <em>ArrayName</em> must be an array accessible to the
    caller of <strong>parray</strong>. It may be either local or global.</p>
<p><strong>tcl_endOfWord </strong><em>str start</em></p>
<p>:   Returns the index of the first end-of-word location that occurs
    after a starting index <em>start</em> in the string <em>str</em>. An end-of-word
    location is defined to be the first non-word character following the
    first word character after the starting point. Returns -1 if there
    are no more end-of-word locations after the starting point. See the
    description of <strong>tcl_wordchars</strong> and <strong>tcl_nonwordchars</strong> below for
    more details on how Tcl determines which characters are word
    characters.</p>
<p><strong>tcl_startOfNextWord </strong><em>str start</em></p>
<p>:   Returns the index of the first start-of-word location that occurs
    after a starting index <em>start</em> in the string <em>str</em>. A start-of-word
    location is defined to be the first word character following a
    non-word character. Returns -1 if there are no more start-of-word
    locations after the starting point.</p>
<p><strong>tcl_startOfPreviousWord </strong><em>str start</em></p>
<p>:   Returns the index of the first start-of-word location that occurs
    before a starting index <em>start</em> in the string <em>str</em>. Returns -1 if
    there are no more start-of-word locations before the starting point.</p>
<p><strong>tcl_wordBreakAfter </strong><em>str start</em></p>
<p>:   Returns the index of the first word boundary after the starting
    index <em>start</em> in the string <em>str</em>. Returns -1 if there are no more
    boundaries after the starting point in the given string. The index
    returned refers to the second character of the pair that comprises a
    boundary.</p>
<p><strong>tcl_wordBreakBefore </strong><em>str start</em></p>
<p>:   Returns the index of the first word boundary before the starting
    index <em>start</em> in the string <em>str</em>. Returns -1 if there are no more
    boundaries before the starting point in the given string. The index
    returned refers to the second character of the pair that comprises a
    boundary.</p>
<h1 id="variables">VARIABLES</h1>
<p>The following global variables are defined or used by the procedures in
the Tcl library. They fall into two broad classes, handling unknown
commands and packages, and determining what are words.</p>
<h2 id="autoloading-and-package-management-variables">AUTOLOADING AND PACKAGE MANAGEMENT VARIABLES</h2>
<p><strong>auto_execs</strong></p>
<p>:   Used by <strong>auto_execok</strong> to record information about whether
    particular commands exist as executable files.</p>
<p><strong>auto_index</strong></p>
<p>:   Used by <strong>auto_load</strong> to save the index information read from disk.</p>
<p><strong>auto_noexec</strong></p>
<p>:   If set to any value, then <strong>unknown</strong> will not attempt to auto-exec
    any commands.</p>
<p><strong>auto_noload</strong></p>
<p>:   If set to any value, then <strong>unknown</strong> will not attempt to auto-load
    any commands.</p>
<p><strong>auto_path</strong></p>
<p>:   If set, then it must contain a valid Tcl list giving directories to
    search during auto-load operations (including for package index
    files when using the default <strong>package unknown</strong> handler). This
    variable is initialized during startup to contain, in order: the
    directories listed in the <strong>TCLLIBPATH</strong> environment variable, the
    directory named by the <strong>tcl_library</strong> global variable, the parent
    directory of <strong>tcl_library</strong>, the directories listed in the
    <strong>tcl_pkgPath</strong> variable. Additional locations to look for files and
    package indices should normally be added to this variable using
    <strong>lappend</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>env(TCL_LIBRARY)</strong></p>
<p>:   If set, then it specifies the location of the directory containing
    library scripts (the value of this variable will be assigned to the
    <strong>tcl_library</strong> variable and therefore returned by the command
    <strong>info library</strong>). If this variable is not set then a default value
    is used.</p>
<p><strong>env(TCLLIBPATH)</strong></p>
<p>:   If set, then it must contain a valid Tcl list giving directories to
    search during auto-load operations. Directories must be specified in
    Tcl format, using</p>
<p>as the path separator, regardless of platform. This variable is only
used when initializing the <strong>auto_path</strong> variable.</p>
<h2 id="word-boundary-determination-variables">WORD BOUNDARY DETERMINATION VARIABLES</h2>
<p>These variables are only used in the <strong>tcl_endOfWord</strong>,
<strong>tcl_startOfNextWord</strong>, <strong>tcl_startOfPreviousWord</strong>,
<strong>tcl_wordBreakAfter</strong>, and <strong>tcl_wordBreakBefore</strong> commands.</p>
<p><strong>tcl_nonwordchars</strong></p>
<p>:   This variable contains a regular expression that is used by routines
    like <strong>tcl_endOfWord</strong> to identify whether a character is part of a
    word or not. If the pattern matches a character, the character is
    considered to be a non-word character. The default is \"\W\".</p>
<p><strong>tcl_wordchars</strong></p>
<p>:   This variable contains a regular expression that is used by routines
    like <strong>tcl_endOfWord</strong> to identify whether a character is part of a
    word or not. If the pattern matches a character, the character is
