<p>argc, argv, argv0, auto_path, env, errorCode, errorInfo,
tcl_interactive, tcl_library, tcl_nonwordchars, tcl_patchLevel,
tcl_pkgPath, tcl_platform, tcl_rcFileName, tcl_traceCompile,
tcl_traceExec, tcl_wordchars, tcl_version - Variables used by Tcl</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The following global variables are created and managed automatically by
the Tcl library. Except where noted below, these variables should
normally be treated as read-only by application-specific code and by
users.</p>
<p><strong>auto_path</strong></p>
<p>:   If set, then it must contain a valid Tcl list giving directories to
    search during auto-load operations (including for package index
    files when using the default <strong>package unknown</strong> handler). This
    variable is initialized during startup to contain, in order: the
    directories listed in the <strong>TCLLIBPATH</strong> environment variable, the
    directory named by the <strong>tcl_library</strong> global variable, the parent
    directory of <strong>tcl_library</strong>, the directories listed in the
    <strong>tcl_pkgPath</strong> variable. Additional locations to look for files and
    package indices should normally be added to this variable using
    <strong>lappend</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>Additional variables relating to package management exist. More
details are listed in the **VARIABLES** section of the **library**
manual page.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>env</strong></p>
<p>:   This variable is maintained by Tcl as an array whose elements are
    the environment variables for the process. Reading an element will
    return the value of the corresponding environment variable. Setting
    an element of the array will modify the corresponding environment
    variable or create a new one if it does not already exist. Unsetting
    an element of <strong>env</strong> will remove the corresponding environment
    variable. Changes to the <strong>env</strong> array will affect the environment
    passed to children by commands like <strong>exec</strong>. If the entire <strong>env</strong>
    array is unset then Tcl will stop monitoring <strong>env</strong> accesses and
    will not update environment variables.</p>
<pre><code>Under Windows, the environment variables PATH and COMSPEC in any
capitalization are converted automatically to upper case. For
instance, the PATH variable could be exported by the operating
system as

etc., causing otherwise simple Tcl code to have to support many
special cases. All other environment variables inherited by Tcl are
left unmodified. Setting an env array variable to blank is the same
as unsetting it as this is the behavior of the underlying Windows
OS. It should be noted that relying on an existing and empty
environment variable will not work on Windows and is discouraged for
cross-platform usage.

The following elements of **env** are special to Tcl:

**env(HOME)**

:   This environment variable, if set, gives the location of the
    directory considered to be the current user\'s home directory.
    The value of this variable is returned by the **file home**
    command. Most platforms set this correctly by default; it does
    not normally need to be set by user code. On Windows, if not
    already set, it is set to the value of the **USERPROFILE**
    environment variable.

**env(TCL_LIBRARY)**

:   If set, then it specifies the location of the directory
    containing library scripts (the value of this variable will be
    assigned to the **tcl_library** variable and therefore returned
    by the command **info library**). If this variable is not set
    then a default value is used.

    Note that this environment variable should *not* normally be
    set.

**env(TCLLIBPATH)**

:   If set, then it must contain a valid Tcl list giving directories
    to search during auto-load operations. Directories must be
    specified in Tcl format, using

as the path separator, regardless of platform. This variable is only
used when initializing the **auto_path** variable.

**env(TCL_TZ)**, **env(TZ)**

:   These specify the default timezone used for parsing and
    formatting times and dates in the **clock** command. On many
    platforms, the TZ environment variable is set up by the
    operating system.

**env(LC_ALL)**, **env(LC_MESSAGES)**, **env(LANG)**

:   These environment variables are used by the **msgcat** package
    to determine what locale to format messages using.

**env(TCL_INTERP_DEBUG_FRAME)**

:   If existing, it has the same effect as running **interp debug**
    **{} -frame 1** as the very first command of each new Tcl
    interpreter.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>errorCode</strong></p>
<p>:   This variable holds the value of the <strong>-errorcode</strong> return option
    set by the most recent error that occurred in this interpreter. This
    list value represents additional information about the error in a
    form that is easy to process with programs. The first element of the
    list identifies a general class of errors, and determines the format
    of the rest of the list. The following formats for <strong>-errorcode</strong>
    return options are used by the Tcl core; individual applications may
    define additional formats.</p>
<pre><code>**ARITH*** code msg*

:   This format is used when an arithmetic error occurs (e.g. an
    attempt to divide zero by zero in the **expr** command). *Code*
    identifies the precise error and *msg* provides a human-readable
    description of the error. *Code* will be either DIVZERO (for an
    attempt to divide by zero), DOMAIN (if an argument is outside
    the domain of a function, such as acos(-3)), IOVERFLOW (for
    integer overflow), OVERFLOW (for a floating-point overflow), or
    UNKNOWN (if the cause of the error cannot be determined).

    Detection of these errors depends in part on the underlying
    hardware and system libraries.

**CHILDKILLED*** pid sigName msg*

:   This format is used when a child process has been killed because
    of a signal. The *pid* element will be the process\'s identifier
    (in decimal). The *sigName* element will be the symbolic name of
    the signal that caused the process to terminate; it will be one
    of the names from the include file signal.h, such as
    **SIGPIPE**. The *msg* element will be a short human-readable
    message describing the signal, such as

for **SIGPIPE**.

**CHILDSTATUS*** pid code*

:   This format is used when a child process has exited with a
    non-zero exit status. The *pid* element will be the process\'s
    identifier (in decimal) and the *code* element will be the exit
    code returned by the process (also in decimal).

**CHILDSUSP*** pid sigName msg*

:   This format is used when a child process has been suspended
    because of a signal. The *pid* element will be the process\'s
    identifier, in decimal. The *sigName* element will be the
    symbolic name of the signal that caused the process to suspend;
    this will be one of the names from the include file signal.h,
    such as **SIGTTIN**. The *msg* element will be a short
    human-readable message describing the signal, such as

for **SIGTTIN**.

**NONE**

:   This format is used for errors where no additional information
    is available for an error besides the message returned with the
    error. In these cases the **-errorcode** return option will
    consist of a list containing a single element whose contents are
    **NONE**.

**POSIX ***errName msg*

:   If the first element is **POSIX**, then the error occurred
    during a POSIX kernel call. The *errName* element will contain
    the symbolic name of the error that occurred, such as
    **ENOENT**; this will be one of the values defined in the
    include file errno.h. The *msg* element will be a human-readable
    message corresponding to *errName*, such as

for the **ENOENT** case.

**TCL** \...

:   Indicates some sort of problem generated in relation to Tcl
    itself, e.g. a failure to look up a channel or variable.

To set the **-errorcode** return option, applications should use
library procedures such as **Tcl_SetObjErrorCode**,
**Tcl_SetReturnOptions**, and **Tcl_PosixError**, or they may invoke
the **-errorcode** option of the **return** command. If none of
these methods for setting the error code has been used, the Tcl
interpreter will reset the variable to **NONE** after the next
error.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>errorInfo</strong></p>
<p>:   This variable holds the value of the <strong>-errorinfo</strong> return option
    set by the most recent error that occurred in this interpreter. This
    string value will contain one or more lines identifying the Tcl
    commands and procedures that were being executed when the most
    recent error occurred. Its contents take the form of a stack trace
    showing the various nested Tcl commands that had been invoked at the
    time of the error.</p>
<p><strong>tcl_library</strong></p>
<p>:   This variable holds the name of a directory containing the system
    library of Tcl scripts, such as those used for auto-loading. The
    value of this variable is returned by the <strong>info library</strong> command.
    See the <strong>library</strong> manual entry for details of the facilities
    provided by the Tcl script library. Normally each application or
    package will have its own application-specific script library in
    addition to the Tcl script library; each application should set a
    global variable with a name like <strong>\$</strong><em>app</em><strong>_library</strong> (where
    <em>app</em> is the application\'s name) to hold the network file name for
    that application\'s library directory. The initial value of
    <strong>tcl_library</strong> is set when an interpreter is created by searching
    several different directories until one is found that contains an
    appropriate Tcl startup script. If the <strong>TCL_LIBRARY</strong> environment
    variable exists, then the directory it names is checked first. If
    <strong>TCL_LIBRARY</strong> is not set or doesn\'t refer to an appropriate
    directory, then Tcl checks several other directories based on a
    compiled-in default location, the location of the binary containing
    the application, and the current working directory.</p>
<p><strong>tcl_patchLevel</strong></p>
<p>:   When an interpreter is created Tcl initializes this variable to hold
    a string giving the current patch level for Tcl, such as <strong>8.4.16</strong>
    for Tcl 8.4 with the first sixteen official patches, or <strong>8.5b3</strong>
    for the third beta release of Tcl 8.5. The value of this variable is
    returned by the <strong>info patchlevel</strong> command.</p>
<p><strong>tcl_pkgPath</strong></p>
<p>:   This variable holds a list of directories indicating where packages
    are normally installed. It is not used on Windows. It typically
    contains either one or two entries; if it contains two entries, the
    first is normally a directory for platform-dependent packages (e.g.,
    shared library binaries) and the second is normally a directory for
    platform-independent packages (e.g., script files). Typically a
    package is installed as a subdirectory of one of the entries in the
    <strong>tcl_pkgPath</strong> variable. The directories in the <strong>tcl_pkgPath</strong>
    variable are included by default in the <strong>auto_path</strong> variable, so
    they and their immediate subdirectories are automatically searched
    for packages during <strong>package require</strong> commands. Note:
    <strong>tcl_pkgPath</strong> is not intended to be modified by the application.
    Its value is added to <strong>auto_path</strong> at startup; changes to
    <strong>tcl_pkgPath</strong> are not reflected in <strong>auto_path</strong>. If you want Tcl
    to search additional directories for packages you should add the
    names of those directories to <strong>auto_path</strong>, not <strong>tcl_pkgPath</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>tcl_platform</strong></p>
<p>:   This is an associative array whose elements contain information
    about the platform on which the application is running, such as the
    name of the operating system, its current release number, and the
    machine\'s instruction set. The elements listed below will always be
    defined, but they may have empty strings as values if Tcl could not
    retrieve any relevant information. In addition, extensions and
    applications may add additional values to the array. The predefined
    elements are:</p>
<pre><code>**byteOrder**

:   The native byte order of this machine: either **littleEndian**
    or **bigEndian**.

**debug**

:   If this variable exists, then the interpreter was compiled with
    and linked to a debug-enabled C run-time. This variable will
    only exist on Windows, so extension writers can specify which
    package to load depending on the C run-time library that is in
    use. This is not an indication that this core contains symbols.

**engine**

:   The name of the Tcl language implementation. When the
    interpreter is first created, this is always set to the string
    **Tcl**.

**machine**

:   The instruction set executed by this machine, such as **intel**,
    **PPC**, **68k**, or **sun4m**. On UNIX machines, this is the
    value returned by **uname -m**.

**os**

:   The name of the operating system running on this machine, such
    as **Windows NT** or **SunOS**. On UNIX machines, this is the
    value returned by **uname -s**.

**osVersion**

:   The version number for the operating system running on this
    machine. On UNIX machines, this is the value returned by **uname
    -r**.

**pathSeparator**

:   The character that should be used to **split** PATH-like
    environment variables into their corresponding list of directory
    names.

**platform**

:   Either **windows**, or **unix**. This identifies the general
    operating environment of the machine.

**pointerSize**

:   This gives the size of the native-machine pointer in bytes
    (strictly, it is same as the result of evaluating
    *sizeof(void\*)* in C.)

**threaded**

:   If this variable exists, then the interpreter was compiled with
    threads enabled.

**user**

:   This identifies the current user based on the login information
    available on the platform. This value comes from the getuid()
    and getpwuid() system calls on Unix, and the value from the
    GetUserName() system call on Windows.

**wordSize**

:   This gives the size of the native-machine word in bytes
    (strictly, it is same as the result of evaluating *sizeof(long)*
    in C.)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>tcl_traceCompile</strong></p>
<p>:   The value of this variable can be set to control how much tracing
    information is displayed during bytecode compilation. By default,
    <strong>tcl_traceCompile</strong> is zero and no information is displayed.
    Setting <strong>tcl_traceCompile</strong> to 1 generates a one-line summary in
    <strong>stdout</strong> whenever a procedure or top-level command is compiled.
    Setting it to 2 generates a detailed listing in <strong>stdout</strong> of the
    bytecode instructions emitted during every compilation. This
    variable is useful in tracking down suspected problems with the Tcl
    compiler.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This variable and functionality only exist if <strong>TCL_COMPILE_DEBUG</strong>
was defined during Tcl\'s compilation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>tcl_traceExec</strong></p>
<p>:   The value of this variable can be set to control how much tracing
    information is displayed during bytecode execution. By default,
    <strong>tcl_traceExec</strong> is zero and no information is displayed. Setting
    <strong>tcl_traceExec</strong> to 1 generates a one-line trace in <strong>stdout</strong> on
    each call to a Tcl procedure. Setting it to 2 generates a line of
    output whenever any Tcl command is invoked that contains the name of
    the command and its arguments. Setting it to 3 produces a detailed
    trace showing the result of executing each bytecode instruction.
    Note that when <strong>tcl_traceExec</strong> is 2 or 3, commands such as <strong>set</strong>
    and <strong>incr</strong> that have been entirely replaced by a sequence of
    bytecode instructions are not shown. Setting this variable is useful
    in tracking down suspected problems with the bytecode compiler and
    interpreter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This variable and functionality only exist if <strong>TCL_COMPILE_DEBUG</strong>
was defined during Tcl\'s compilation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>tcl_wordchars</strong></p>
<p>:   The value of this variable is a regular expression that can be set
    to control what are considered</p>
<p>characters, for instances like selecting a word by double-clicking in
text in Tk. It is platform dependent. On Windows, it defaults to
<strong>\S</strong>, meaning anything but a Unicode space character. Otherwise it
defaults to <strong>\w</strong>, which is any Unicode word character (number,
letter, or underscore).</p>
<p><strong>tcl_nonwordchars</strong></p>
<p>:   The value of this variable is a regular expression that can be set
    to control what are considered</p>
<p>characters, for instances like selecting a word by double-clicking in
text in Tk. It is platform dependent. On Windows, it defaults to
<strong>\s</strong>, meaning any Unicode space character. Otherwise it defaults to
<strong>\W</strong>, which is anything but a Unicode word character (number, letter,
or underscore).</p>
<p><strong>tcl_version</strong></p>
<p>:   When an interpreter is created Tcl initializes this variable to hold
    the version number for this version of Tcl in the form <em>x.y</em>.
    Changes to <em>x</em> represent major changes with probable
    incompatibilities and changes to <em>y</em> represent small enhancements
    and bug fixes that retain backward compatibility. The value of this
    variable is returned by the <strong>info tclversion</strong> command.</p>
<h1 id="other-global-variables">OTHER GLOBAL VARIABLES</h1>
<p>The following variables are only guaranteed to exist in <strong>tclsh</strong> and
<strong>wish</strong> executables; the Tcl library does not define them itself but
many Tcl environments do.</p>
<p><strong>argc</strong></p>
<p>:   The number of arguments to <strong>tclsh</strong> or <strong>wish</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>argv</strong></p>
<p>:   Tcl list of arguments to <strong>tclsh</strong> or <strong>wish</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>argv0</strong></p>
<p>:   The script that <strong>tclsh</strong> or <strong>wish</strong> started executing (if it was
    specified) or otherwise the name by which <strong>tclsh</strong> or <strong>wish</strong> was
    invoked.</p>
<p><strong>tcl_interactive</strong></p>
<p>:   Contains 1 if <strong>tclsh</strong> or <strong>wish</strong> is running interactively (no
    script was specified and standard input is a terminal-like device),
    0 otherwise.</p>
<h1 id="examples">EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>To add a directory to the collection of locations searched by <strong>package
require</strong>, e.g., because of some application-specific packages that are
used, the <strong>auto_path</strong> variable needs to be updated:</p>
<p>lappend ::<strong>auto_path</strong> [file join [pwd] \"theLibDir\"]</p>
<p>A simple though not very robust way to handle command line arguments of
the form</p>
<p>is to load them into an array having first loaded in the default
settings:</p>
<p>array set arguments {-foo 0 -bar 0 -grill 0} array set arguments
\$::<strong>argv</strong> puts \"foo is \$arguments(-foo)\" puts \"bar is
\$arguments(-bar)\" puts \"grill is \$arguments(-grill)\"</p>
<p>The <strong>argv0</strong> global variable can be used (in conjunction with the
<strong>info script</strong> command) to determine whether the current script is
being executed as the main script or loaded as a library. This is useful
because it allows a single script to be used as both a library and a
demonstration of that library:</p>
<p>if {\$::<strong>argv0</strong> eq [info script]} { # running as: tclsh example.tcl
} else { package provide Example 1.0 }</p>
