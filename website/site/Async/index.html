<p>Procedure to invoke to handle an asynchronous event.</p>
<p>One-word value to pass to <em>proc</em>.</p>
<p>Token for asynchronous event handler.</p>
<p>POSIX signal number, when used in a signal context.</p>
<p>Tcl interpreter in which command was being evaluated when handler was

active.</p>
<p>Completion code from command that just completed in <em>interp</em>, or 0 if
<em>interp</em> is NULL.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>These procedures provide a safe mechanism for dealing with asynchronous
events such as signals. If an event such as a signal occurs while a Tcl
script is being evaluated then it is not safe to take any substantive
action to process the event. For example, it is not safe to evaluate a
Tcl script since the interpreter may already be in the middle of
evaluating a script; it may not even be safe to allocate memory, since a
memory allocation could have been in progress when the event occurred.
The only safe approach is to set a flag indicating that the event
occurred, then handle the event later when the world has returned to a
clean state, such as after the current Tcl command completes.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_AsyncCreate</strong>, <strong>Tcl_AsyncDelete</strong>, and <strong>Tcl_AsyncReady</strong> are
thread sensitive. They access and/or set a thread-specific data
structure in the event of a core built with <em>--enable-threads</em>. The
token created by <strong>Tcl_AsyncCreate</strong> contains the needed thread
information it was called from so that calling
<strong>Tcl_AsyncMarkFromSignal</strong> or <strong>Tcl_AsyncMark</strong> with this token will
only yield the origin thread into the asynchronous handler.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_AsyncCreate</strong> creates an asynchronous handler and returns a token
for it. The asynchronous handler must be created before any occurrences
of the asynchronous event that it is intended to handle (it is not safe
to create a handler at the time of an event). When an asynchronous event
occurs the code that detects the event (such as a POSIX signal handler)
should call <strong>Tcl_AsyncMarkFromSignal</strong> with the token for the handler
and the POSIX signal number. The return value of this function is true,
when the handler will be marked, false otherwise. For non-signal
contexts, <strong>Tcl_AsyncMark</strong> serves the same purpose.
<strong>Tcl_AsyncMarkFromSignal</strong> and <strong>Tcl_AsyncMark</strong> will mark the handler
as ready to execute, but will not invoke the handler immediately. Tcl
will call the <em>proc</em> associated with the handler later, when the world
is in a safe state, and <em>proc</em> can then carry out the actions associated
with the asynchronous event. <em>Proc</em> should have arguments and result
that match the type <strong>Tcl_AsyncProc</strong>:</p>
<p>typedef int <strong>Tcl_AsyncProc</strong>( void *<em>clientData</em>, Tcl_Interp
*<em>interp</em>, int <em>code</em>);</p>
<p>The <em>clientData</em> will be the same as the <em>clientData</em> argument passed to
<strong>Tcl_AsyncCreate</strong> when the handler was created. If <em>proc</em> is invoked
just after a command has completed execution in an interpreter, then
<em>interp</em> will identify the interpreter in which the command was
evaluated and <em>code</em> will be the completion code returned by that
command. The command\'s result will be present in the interpreter\'s
result. When <em>proc</em> returns, whatever it leaves in the interpreter\'s
result will be returned as the result of the command and the integer
value returned by <em>proc</em> will be used as the new completion code for the
command.</p>
<p>It is also possible for <em>proc</em> to be invoked when no interpreter is
active. This can happen, for example, if an asynchronous event occurs
while the application is waiting for interactive input or an X event. In
this case <em>interp</em> will be NULL and <em>code</em> will be 0, and the return
value from <em>proc</em> will be ignored.</p>
<p>The procedure <strong>Tcl_AsyncInvoke</strong> is called to invoke all of the
handlers that are ready. The procedure <strong>Tcl_AsyncReady</strong> will return
non-zero whenever any asynchronous handlers are ready; it can be checked
to avoid calls to <strong>Tcl_AsyncInvoke</strong> when there are no ready handlers.
Tcl calls <strong>Tcl_AsyncReady</strong> after each command is evaluated and calls
<strong>Tcl_AsyncInvoke</strong> if needed. Applications may also call
<strong>Tcl_AsyncInvoke</strong> at interesting times for that application. For
example, Tcl\'s event handler calls <strong>Tcl_AsyncReady</strong> after each event
and calls <strong>Tcl_AsyncInvoke</strong> if needed. The <em>interp</em> and <em>code</em>
arguments to <strong>Tcl_AsyncInvoke</strong> have the same meaning as for <em>proc</em>:
they identify the active interpreter, if any, and the completion code
from the command that just completed.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_AsyncDelete</strong> removes an asynchronous handler so that its <em>proc</em>
will never be invoked again. A handler can be deleted even when ready,
and it will still not be invoked.</p>
<p>If multiple handlers become active at the same time, the handlers are
invoked in the order they were created (oldest handler first). The
<em>code</em> and the interpreter\'s result for later handlers reflect the
values returned by earlier handlers, so that the most recently created
handler has last say about the interpreter\'s result and completion
code. If new handlers become ready while handlers are executing,
<strong>Tcl_AsyncInvoke</strong> will invoke them all; at each point it invokes the
highest-priority (oldest) ready handler, repeating this over and over
until there are no longer any ready handlers.</p>
<h1 id="warning">WARNING</h1>
<p>It is almost always a bad idea for an asynchronous event handler to
modify the interpreter\'s result or return a code different from its
<em>code</em> argument. This sort of behavior can disrupt the execution of
scripts in subtle ways and result in bugs that are extremely difficult
to track down. If an asynchronous event handler needs to evaluate Tcl
scripts then it should first save the interpreter\'s state by calling
<strong>Tcl_SaveInterpState</strong>, passing in the <em>code</em> argument. When the
asynchronous handler is finished it should restore the interpreter\'s
state by calling <strong>Tcl_RestoreInterpState</strong>, and then returning the
<em>code</em> argument.</p>
