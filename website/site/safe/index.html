<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Safe Tcl is a mechanism for executing untrusted Tcl scripts safely and
for providing mediated access by such scripts to potentially dangerous
functionality.</p>
<p>Safe Tcl ensures that untrusted Tcl scripts cannot harm the hosting
application. It prevents integrity and privacy attacks. Untrusted Tcl
scripts are prevented from corrupting the state of the hosting
application or computer. Untrusted scripts are also prevented from
disclosing information stored on the hosting computer or in the hosting
application to any party.</p>
<p>Safe Tcl allows a parent interpreter to create safe, restricted
interpreters that contain a set of predefined aliases for the
<strong>source</strong>, <strong>load</strong>, <strong>file</strong>, <strong>encoding</strong>, and <strong>exit</strong> commands and
are able to use the auto-loading and package mechanisms.</p>
<p>No knowledge of the file system structure is leaked to the safe
interpreter, because it has access only to a virtualized path containing
tokens. When the safe interpreter requests to source a file, it uses the
token in the virtual path as part of the file name to source; the parent
interpreter transparently translates the token into a real directory
name and executes the requested operation (see the section <strong>SECURITY</strong>
below for details). Different levels of security can be selected by
using the optional flags of the commands described below.</p>
<p>All commands provided in the parent interpreter by Safe Tcl reside in
the <strong>safe</strong> namespace.</p>
<h1 id="commands">COMMANDS</h1>
<p>The following commands are provided in the parent interpreter:</p>
<p><strong>::safe::interpCreate</strong> ?<em>child</em>? ?<em>options...</em>?</p>
<p>:   Creates a safe interpreter, installs the aliases described in the
    section <strong>ALIASES</strong> and initializes the auto-loading and package
    mechanism as specified by the supplied <em>options</em>. See the
    <strong>OPTIONS</strong> section below for a description of the optional
    arguments. If the <em>child</em> argument is omitted, a name will be
    generated. <strong>::safe::interpCreate</strong> always returns the interpreter
    name.</p>
<p>The interpreter name <em>child</em> may include namespace separators, but may
not have leading or trailing namespace separators, or excess colon
characters in namespace separators. The interpreter name is qualified
relative to the global namespace ::, not the namespace in which the
<strong>::safe::interpCreate</strong> command is evaluated.</p>
<p><strong>::safe::interpInit</strong> <em>child</em> ?<em>options...</em>?</p>
<p>:   This command is similar to <strong>interpCreate</strong> except it that does not
    create the safe interpreter. <em>child</em> must have been created by some
    other means, like <strong>interp create</strong> <strong>-safe</strong>. The interpreter name
    <em>child</em> may include namespace separators, subject to the same
    restrictions as for <strong>interpCreate</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>::safe::interpConfigure</strong> <em>child</em> ?<em>options...</em>?</p>
<p>:   If no <em>options</em> are given, returns the settings for all options for
    the named safe interpreter as a list of options and their current
    values for that <em>child</em>. If a single additional argument is
    provided, it will return a list of 2 elements <em>name</em> and <em>value</em>
    where <em>name</em> is the full name of that option and <em>value</em> the current
    value for that option and the <em>child</em>. If more than two additional
    arguments are provided, it will reconfigure the safe interpreter and
    change each and only the provided options. See the section on
    <strong>OPTIONS</strong> below for options description. Example of use:</p>
<pre><code>\# Create new interp with the same configuration as \"\$i0\": set i1
\[safe::interpCreate {\*}\[safe::interpConfigure \$i0\]\]

\# Get the current deleteHook set dh \[safe::interpConfigure \$i0
-del\]

\# Change (only) the statics loading ok attribute of an \# interp
and its deleteHook (leaving the rest unchanged):
safe::interpConfigure \$i0 -delete {foo bar} -statics 0
</code></pre>
<p><strong>::safe::interpDelete</strong> <em>child</em></p>
<p>:   Deletes the safe interpreter and cleans up the corresponding parent
    interpreter data structures. If a <em>deleteHook</em> script was specified
    for this interpreter it is evaluated before the interpreter is
    deleted, with the name of the interpreter as an additional argument.</p>
<p><strong>::safe::interpFindInAccessPath</strong> <em>child</em> <em>directory</em></p>
<p>:   This command finds and returns the token for the real directory
    <em>directory</em> in the safe interpreter\'s current virtual access path.
    It generates an error if the directory is not found. Example of use:</p>
<pre><code>\$child eval \[list set tk_library \\
\[::safe::interpFindInAccessPath \$name \$tk_library\]\]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>::safe::interpAddToAccessPath</strong> <em>child</em> <em>directory</em></p>
<p>:   This command adds <em>directory</em> to the virtual path maintained for the
    safe interpreter in the parent, and returns the token that can be
    used in the safe interpreter to obtain access to files in that
    directory. If the directory is already in the virtual path, it only
    returns the token without adding the directory to the virtual path
    again. Example of use:</p>
<pre><code>\$child eval \[list set tk_library \\
\[::safe::interpAddToAccessPath \$name \$tk_library\]\]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>::safe::setSyncMode</strong> ?<em>newValue</em>?</p>
<p>:   This command is used to get or set the \"Sync Mode\" of the Safe
    Base. When an argument is supplied, the command returns an error if
    the argument is not a boolean value, or if any Safe Base
    interpreters exist. Typically the value will be set as part of
    initialization - boolean true for \"Sync Mode\" on (the default),
    false for \"Sync Mode\" off. With \"Sync Mode\" on, the Safe Base
    keeps each child interpreter\'s ::auto_path synchronized with its
    access path. See the section <strong>SYNC MODE</strong> below for details.</p>
<p><strong>::safe::setLogCmd</strong> ?<em>cmd arg...</em>?</p>
<p>:   This command installs a script that will be called when interesting
    life cycle events occur for a safe interpreter. When called with no
    arguments, it returns the currently installed script. When called
    with one argument, an empty string, the currently installed script
    is removed and logging is turned off. The script will be invoked
    with one additional argument, a string describing the event of
    interest. The main purpose is to help in debugging safe
    interpreters. Using this facility you can get complete error
    messages while the safe interpreter gets only generic error
    messages. This prevents a safe interpreter from seeing messages
    about failures and other events that might contain sensitive
    information such as real directory names.</p>
<pre><code>Example of use:

::safe::setLogCmd puts stderr

Below is the output of a sample session in which a safe interpreter
attempted to source a file not found in its virtual access path.
Note that the safe interpreter only received an error message saying
that the file was not found:

NOTICE for child interp10 : Created NOTICE for child interp10 :
Setting accessPath=(/foo/bar) staticsok=1 nestedok=0 deletehook=()
NOTICE for child interp10 : auto_path in interp10 has been set to
{\$p(:0:)} ERROR for child interp10 : /foo/bar/init.tcl: no such
file or directory
</code></pre>
<h2 id="options_1">OPTIONS</h2>
<p>The following options are common to <strong>::safe::interpCreate</strong>,
<strong>::safe::interpInit</strong>, and <strong>::safe::interpConfigure</strong>. Any option name
can be abbreviated to its minimal non-ambiguous name. Option names are
not case sensitive.</p>
<p><strong>-accessPath</strong> <em>directoryList</em></p>
<p>:   This option sets the list of directories from which the safe
    interpreter can <strong>source</strong> and <strong>load</strong> files. If this option is not
    specified, or if it is given as the empty list, the safe interpreter
    will use the same directories as its parent for auto-loading. See
    the section <strong>SECURITY</strong> below for more detail about virtual paths,
    tokens and access control.</p>
<p><strong>-autoPath</strong> <em>directoryList</em></p>
<p>:   This option sets the list of directories in the safe interpreter\'s
    ::auto_path. The option is undefined if the Safe Base has \"Sync
    Mode\" on - in that case the safe interpreter\'s ::auto_path is
    managed by the Safe Base and is a tokenized form of its access path.
    See the section <strong>SYNC MODE</strong> below for details.</p>
<p><strong>-statics</strong> <em>boolean</em></p>
<p>:   This option specifies if the safe interpreter will be allowed to
    load statically linked packages (like <strong>load {} Tk</strong>). The default
    value is <strong>true</strong> : safe interpreters are allowed to load statically
    linked packages.</p>
<p><strong>-noStatics</strong></p>
<p>:   This option is a convenience shortcut for <strong>-statics false</strong> and
    thus specifies that the safe interpreter will not be allowed to load
    statically linked packages.</p>
<p><strong>-nested</strong> <em>boolean</em></p>
<p>:   This option specifies if the safe interpreter will be allowed to
    load packages into its own sub-interpreters. The default value is
    <strong>false</strong> : safe interpreters are not allowed to load packages into
    their own sub-interpreters.</p>
<p><strong>-nestedLoadOk</strong></p>
<p>:   This option is a convenience shortcut for <strong>-nested true</strong> and thus
    specifies the safe interpreter will be allowed to load packages into
    its own sub-interpreters.</p>
<p><strong>-deleteHook</strong> <em>script</em></p>
<p>:   When this option is given a non-empty <em>script</em>, it will be evaluated
    in the parent with the name of the safe interpreter as an additional
    argument just before actually deleting the safe interpreter. Giving
    an empty value removes any currently installed deletion hook script
    for that safe interpreter. The default value (<strong>{}</strong>) is not to have
    any deletion call back.</p>
<h1 id="aliases">ALIASES</h1>
<p>The following aliases are provided in a safe interpreter:</p>
<p><strong>source</strong> <em>fileName</em></p>
<p>:   The requested file, a Tcl source file, is sourced into the safe
    interpreter if it is found. The <strong>source</strong> alias can only source
    files from directories in the virtual path for the safe interpreter.
    The <strong>source</strong> alias requires the safe interpreter to use one of the
    token names in its virtual path to denote the directory in which the
    file to be sourced can be found. See the section on <strong>SECURITY</strong> for
    more discussion of restrictions on valid filenames.</p>
<p><strong>load</strong> <em>fileName</em></p>
<p>:   The requested file, a shared object file, is dynamically loaded into
    the safe interpreter if it is found. The filename must contain a
    token name mentioned in the virtual path for the safe interpreter
    for it to be found successfully. Additionally, the shared object
    file must contain a safe entry point; see the manual page for the
    <strong>load</strong> command for more details.</p>
<p><strong>file</strong> ?<em>subCmd args...</em>?</p>
<p>:   The <strong>file</strong> alias provides access to a safe subset of the
    subcommands of the <strong>file</strong> command; it allows only <strong>dirname</strong>,
    <strong>join</strong>, <strong>extension</strong>, <strong>root</strong>, <strong>tail</strong>, <strong>pathname</strong> and
    <strong>split</strong> subcommands. For more details on what these subcommands do
    see the manual page for the <strong>file</strong> command.</p>
<p><strong>encoding</strong> ?<em>subCmd args...</em>?</p>
<p>:   The <strong>encoding</strong> alias provides access to a safe subset of the
    subcommands of the <strong>encoding</strong> command; it disallows setting of the
    system encoding, but allows all other subcommands including
    <strong>system</strong> to check the current encoding.</p>
<p><strong>exit</strong></p>
<p>:   The calling interpreter is deleted and its computation is stopped,
    but the Tcl process in which this interpreter exists is not
    terminated.</p>
<h1 id="security">SECURITY</h1>
<p>Safe Tcl does not attempt to completely prevent annoyance and denial of
service attacks. These forms of attack prevent the application or user
from temporarily using the computer to perform useful work, for example
by consuming all available CPU time or all available screen real estate.
These attacks, while aggravating, are deemed to be of lesser importance
in general than integrity and privacy attacks that Safe Tcl is to
prevent.</p>
<p>The commands available in a safe interpreter, in addition to the safe
set as defined in <strong>interp</strong> manual page, are mediated aliases for
<strong>source</strong>, <strong>load</strong>, <strong>exit</strong>, and safe subsets of <strong>file</strong> and
<strong>encoding</strong>. The safe interpreter can also auto-load code and it can
request that packages be loaded.</p>
<p>Because some of these commands access the local file system, there is a
potential for information leakage about its directory structure. To
prevent this, commands that take file names as arguments in a safe
interpreter use tokens instead of the real directory names. These tokens
are translated to the real directory name while a request to, e.g.,
source a file is mediated by the parent interpreter. This virtual path
system is maintained in the parent interpreter for each safe interpreter
created by <strong>::safe::interpCreate</strong> or initialized by
<strong>::safe::interpInit</strong> and the path maps tokens accessible in the safe
interpreter into real path names on the local file system thus
preventing safe interpreters from gaining knowledge about the structure
of the file system of the host on which the interpreter is executing.
The only valid file names arguments for the <strong>source</strong> and <strong>load</strong>
aliases provided to the child are path in the form of <strong>[file join
</strong><em>token filename</em><strong>]</strong> (i.e. when using the native file path formats:
<em>token</em><strong>/</strong><em>filename</em> on Unix and <em>token</em><strong>\</strong><em>filename</em> on Windows),
where <em>token</em> is representing one of the directories of the <em>accessPath</em>
list and <em>filename</em> is one file in that directory (no sub directories
access are allowed).</p>
<p>When a token is used in a safe interpreter in a request to source or
load a file, the token is checked and translated to a real path name and
the file to be sourced or loaded is located on the file system. The safe
interpreter never gains knowledge of the actual path name under which
the file is stored on the file system.</p>
<p>To further prevent potential information leakage from sensitive files
that are accidentally included in the set of files that can be sourced
by a safe interpreter, the <strong>source</strong> alias restricts access to files
meeting the following constraints: the file name must fourteen
characters or shorter, must not contain more than one dot</p>
<p>must end up with the extension</p>
<p>or be called</p>
<p>Each element of the initial access path list will be assigned a token
that will be set in the child <strong>auto_path</strong> and the first element of
that list will be set as the <strong>tcl_library</strong> for that child.</p>
<p>If the access path argument is not given to <strong>::safe::interpCreate</strong> or
<strong>::safe::interpInit</strong> or is the empty list, the default behavior is to
let the child access the same packages as the parent has access to (Or
to be more precise: only packages written in Tcl (which by definition
cannot be dangerous as they run in the child interpreter) and C
extensions that provides a _SafeInit entry point). For that purpose,
the parent\'s <strong>auto_path</strong> will be used to construct the child access
path. In order that the child successfully loads the Tcl library files
(which includes the auto-loading mechanism itself) the <strong>tcl_library</strong>
will be added or moved to the first position if necessary, in the child
access path, so the child <strong>tcl_library</strong> will be the same as the
parent\'s (its real path will still be invisible to the child though).
In order that auto-loading works the same for the child and the parent
in this by default case, the first-level sub directories of each
directory in the parent <strong>auto_path</strong> will also be added (if not already
included) to the child access path. You can always specify a more
restrictive path for which sub directories will never be searched by
explicitly specifying your directory list with the <strong>-accessPath</strong> flag
instead of relying on this default mechanism.</p>
<p>When the <em>accessPath</em> is changed after the first creation or
initialization (i.e. through <strong>interpConfigure -accessPath </strong><em>list</em>), an
<strong>auto_reset</strong> is automatically evaluated in the safe interpreter to
synchronize its <strong>auto_index</strong> with the new token list.</p>
<h1 id="typical-use">TYPICAL USE</h1>
<p>In many cases, the properties of a Safe Base interpreter can be
specified when the interpreter is created, and then left unchanged for
the lifetime of the interpreter.</p>
<p>If you wish to use Safe Base interpreters with \"Sync Mode\" off,
evaluate the command</p>
<blockquote>
<p>safe::setSyncMode 0</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Use <strong>::safe::interpCreate</strong> or <strong>::safe::interpInit</strong> to create an
interpreter with the properties that you require. The simplest way is
not to specify <strong>-accessPath</strong> or <strong>-autoPath</strong>, which means the safe
interpreter will use the same paths as the parent interpreter. However,
if <strong>-accessPath</strong> is specified, then <strong>-autoPath</strong> must also be
specified, or else it will be set to {}.</p>
<p>The value of <strong>-autoPath</strong> will be that required to access tclIndex and
pkgIndex.tcl files according to the same rules as an unsafe interpreter
(see pkg_mkIndex(n) and library(n)).</p>
<p>With \"Sync Mode\" on, the option <strong>-autoPath</strong> is undefined, and the
Safe Base sets the child\'s ::auto_path to a tokenized form of the
access path. In addition to the directories present if \"Safe Mode\" is
off, the ::auto_path includes the numerous subdirectories and module
paths that belong to the access path.</p>
<h1 id="sync-mode">SYNC MODE</h1>
<p>Before Tcl version 8.7, the Safe Base kept each safe interpreter\'s
::auto_path synchronized with a tokenized form of its access path.
Limitations of Tcl 8.4 and earlier made this feature necessary. This
definition of ::auto_path did not conform its specification in
library(n) and pkg_mkIndex(n), but nevertheless worked perfectly well
for the discovery and loading of packages. The introduction of Tcl
modules in Tcl 8.5 added a large number of directories to the access
path, and it is inconvenient to have these additional directories
unnecessarily appended to the ::auto_path.</p>
<p>In order to preserve compatibility with existing code, this
synchronization of the ::auto_path and access path (\"Sync Mode\" on) is
still the default. However, the Safe Base offers the option of limiting
the safe interpreter\'s ::auto_path to the much shorter list of
directories that is necessary for it to perform its function (\"Sync
Mode\" off). Use the command <strong>::safe::setSyncMode</strong> to choose the mode
before creating any Safe Base interpreters.</p>
<p>In either mode, the most convenient way to initialize a safe interpreter
is to call <strong>::safe::interpCreate</strong> or <strong>::safe::interpInit</strong> without
the <strong>-accessPath</strong> or <strong>-autoPath</strong> options (or with the
<strong>-accessPath</strong> option set to the empty list), which will give the safe
interpreter the same access as the parent interpreter to packages,
modules, and autoloader files. With \"Sync Mode\" off, the Safe Base
will set the value of <strong>-autoPath</strong> to the parent\'s ::auto_path, and
will set the child\'s ::auto_path to a tokenized form of the parent\'s
::auto_path.</p>
<p>With \"Sync Mode\" off, if a value is specified for <strong>-autoPath</strong>, even
the empty list, in a call to <strong>::safe::interpCreate</strong>,
<strong>::safe::interpInit</strong>, or <strong>::safe::interpConfigure</strong>, it will be
tokenized and used as the safe interpreter\'s ::auto_path. Any
directories that do not also belong to the access path cannot be
tokenized and will be silently ignored. However, the value of
<strong>-autoPath</strong> will remain as specified, and will be used to re-tokenize
the child\'s ::auto_path if <strong>::safe::interpConfigure</strong> is called to
change the value of <strong>-accessPath</strong>.</p>
<p>With \"Sync Mode\" off, if the access path is reset to the values in the
parent interpreter by calling <strong>::safe::interpConfigure</strong> with arguments
<strong>-accessPath</strong> {}, then the ::auto_path will also be reset unless the
argument <strong>-autoPath</strong> is supplied to specify a different value.</p>
<p>With \"Sync Mode\" off, if a non-empty value of <strong>-accessPath</strong> is
supplied, the safe interpreter\'s ::auto_path will be set to {} (by
<strong>::safe::interpCreate</strong>, <strong>::safe::interpInit</strong>) or left unchanged (by
<strong>::safe::interpConfigure</strong>). If the same command specifies a new value
for <strong>-autoPath</strong>, it will be applied after the <strong>-accessPath</strong> argument
has been processed.</p>
<p>Examples of use with \"Sync Mode\" off: any of these commands will set
the ::auto_path to a tokenized form of its value in the parent
interpreter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>safe::interpCreate foo safe::interpCreate foo -accessPath {}
safe::interpInit bar safe::interpInit bar -accessPath {}
safe::interpConfigure foo -accessPath {}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Example of use with \"Sync Mode\" off: when initializing a safe
interpreter with a non-empty access path, the ::auto_path will be set to
{} unless its own value is also specified:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>safe::interpCreate foo -accessPath { /usr/local/TclHome/lib/tcl8.6
/usr/local/TclHome/lib/tcl8.6/http1.0
/usr/local/TclHome/lib/tcl8.6/opt0.4
/usr/local/TclHome/lib/tcl8.6/msgs
/usr/local/TclHome/lib/tcl8.6/encoding /usr/local/TclHome/lib }</p>
<p># The child\'s ::auto_path must be given a suitable value:</p>
<p>safe::interpConfigure foo -autoPath { /usr/local/TclHome/lib/tcl8.6
/usr/local/TclHome/lib }</p>
<p># The two commands can be combined:</p>
<p>safe::interpCreate foo -accessPath { /usr/local/TclHome/lib/tcl8.6
/usr/local/TclHome/lib/tcl8.6/http1.0
/usr/local/TclHome/lib/tcl8.6/opt0.4
/usr/local/TclHome/lib/tcl8.6/msgs
/usr/local/TclHome/lib/tcl8.6/encoding /usr/local/TclHome/lib }
-autoPath { /usr/local/TclHome/lib/tcl8.6 /usr/local/TclHome/lib }</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Example of use with \"Sync Mode\" off: the command
<strong>safe::interpAddToAccessPath</strong> does not change the safe interpreter\'s
::auto_path, and so any necessary change must be made by the script:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>safe::interpAddToAccessPath foo
/usr/local/TclHome/lib/extras/Img1.4.11</p>
<p>lassign [safe::interpConfigure foo -autoPath] DUM childAutoPath
lappend childAutoPath /usr/local/TclHome/lib/extras/Img1.4.11
safe::interpConfigure foo -autoPath \$childAutoPath</p>
