<p>binary - Insert and extract fields from binary strings</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>binary decode </strong><em>format</em> ?<em>-option value ...</em>? <em>data</em>\
<strong>binary encode </strong><em>format</em> ?<em>-option value ...</em>? <em>data</em>\
<strong>binary format </strong><em>formatString </em>?<em>arg arg ...</em>?\
<strong>binary scan </strong><em>string formatString </em>?<em>varName varName ...</em>?</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This command provides facilities for manipulating binary data. The
subcommand <strong>binary format</strong> creates a binary string from normal Tcl
values. For example, given the values 16 and 22, on a 32-bit
architecture, it might produce an 8-byte binary string consisting of two
4-byte integers, one for each of the numbers. The subcommand <strong>binary
scan</strong>, does the opposite: it extracts data from a binary string and
returns it as ordinary Tcl string values. The <strong>binary encode</strong> and
<strong>binary decode</strong> subcommands convert binary data to or from string
encodings such as base64 (used in MIME messages for example).</p>
<p>Note that other operations on binary data, such as taking a subsequence
of it, getting its length, or reinterpreting it as a string in some
encoding, are done by other Tcl commands (respectively <strong>string range</strong>,
<strong>string length</strong> and <strong>encoding convertfrom</strong> in the example cases). A
binary string in Tcl is merely one where all the characters it contains
are in the range \u0000-\u00FF.</p>
<h1 id="binary-encode-and-decode">BINARY ENCODE AND DECODE</h1>
<p>When encoding binary data as a readable string, the starting binary data
is passed to the <strong>binary encode</strong> command, together with the name of
the encoding to use and any encoding-specific options desired. Data
which has been encoded can be converted back to binary form using
<strong>binary decode</strong>. The <strong>binary encode</strong> command raises an error if the
<em>data</em> argument is not binary data. The following formats and options
are supported.</p>
<p><strong>base64</strong></p>
<p>:   The <strong>base64</strong> binary encoding is commonly used in mail messages and
    XML documents, and uses mostly upper and lower case letters and
    digits. It has the distinction of being able to be rewrapped
    arbitrarily without losing information.</p>
<pre><code>During encoding, the following options are supported:

**-maxlen ***length*

:   Indicates that the output should be split into lines of no more
    than *length* characters. By default, lines are not split.

**-wrapchar ***character*

:   Indicates that, when lines are split because of the **-maxlen**
    option, *character* should be used to separate lines. By
    default, this is a newline character,

During decoding, the following options are supported:

**-strict**

:   Instructs the decoder to throw an error if it encounters any
    characters that are not strictly part of the encoding itself.
    Otherwise it ignores them. RFC 2045 calls for base64 decoders to
    be non-strict.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>hex</strong></p>
<p>:   The <strong>hex</strong> binary encoding converts each byte to a pair of
    hexadecimal digits that represent the byte value as a hexadecimal
    integer. When encoding, lower characters are used. When decoding,
    upper and lower characters are accepted.</p>
<pre><code>No options are supported during encoding. During decoding, the
following options are supported:

**-strict**

:   Instructs the decoder to throw an error if it encounters
    whitespace characters. Otherwise it ignores them.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>uuencode</strong></p>
<p>:   The <strong>uuencode</strong> binary encoding used to be common for transfer of
    data between Unix systems and on USENET, but is less common these
    days, having been largely superseded by the <strong>base64</strong> binary
    encoding.</p>
<pre><code>During encoding, the following options are supported (though
changing them may produce files that other implementations of
decoders cannot process):

**-maxlen ***length*

:   Indicates the maximum number of characters to produce for each
    encoded line. The valid range is 5 to 85. Line lengths outside
    that range cannot be accommodated by the encoding format. The
    default value is 61.

**-wrapchar ***character*

:   Indicates the character(s) to use to mark the end of each
    encoded line. Acceptable values are a sequence of zero or more
    characters from the set { \\x09 (TAB), \\x0B (VT), \\x0C (FF),
    \\x0D (CR) } followed by zero or one newline \\x0A (LF). Any
    other values are rejected because they would generate encoded
    text that could not be decoded. The default value is a single
    newline.

During decoding, the following options are supported:

**-strict**

:   Instructs the decoder to throw an error if it encounters
    anything outside of the standard encoding format. Without this
    option, the decoder tolerates some deviations, mostly to forgive
    reflows of lines between the encoder and decoder.

Note that neither the encoder nor the decoder handle the header and
footer of the uuencode format.
</code></pre>
<h1 id="binary-format">BINARY FORMAT</h1>
<p>The <strong>binary format</strong> command generates a binary string whose layout is
specified by the <em>formatString</em> and whose contents come from the
additional arguments. The resulting binary value is returned.</p>
<p>The <em>formatString</em> consists of a sequence of zero or more field
specifiers separated by zero or more spaces. Each field specifier is a
single type character followed by an optional flag character followed by
an optional numeric <em>count</em>. Most field specifiers consume one argument
to obtain the value to be formatted. The type character specifies how
the value is to be formatted. The <em>count</em> typically indicates how many
items of the specified type are taken from the value. If present, the
<em>count</em> is a non-negative decimal integer or</p>
<p>which normally indicates that all of the items in the value are to be
used. If the number of arguments does not match the number of fields in
the format string that consume arguments, then an error is generated.
The flag character is ignored for <strong>binary format</strong>.</p>
<p>Here is a small example to clarify the relation between the field
specifiers and the arguments:</p>
<p><strong>binary format</strong> d3d {1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0} 0.1</p>
<p>The first argument is a list of four numbers, but because of the count
of 3 for the associated field specifier, only the first three will be
used. The second argument is associated with the second field specifier.
The resulting binary string contains the four numbers 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and
0.1.</p>
<p>Each type-count pair moves an imaginary cursor through the binary data,
storing bytes at the current position and advancing the cursor to just
after the last byte stored. The cursor is initially at position 0 at the
beginning of the data. The type may be any one of the following
characters:</p>
<p>a.  Stores a byte string of length <em>count</em> in the output string. Every
    character is taken as modulo 256 (i.e. the low byte of every
    character is used, and the high byte discarded) so when storing
    character strings not wholly expressible using the characters
    \u0000-\u00ff, the <strong>encoding convertto</strong> command should be used
    first to change the string into an external representation if this
    truncation is not desired (i.e. if the characters are not part of
    the ISO 8859-1 character set.) If <em>arg</em> has fewer than <em>count</em>
    bytes, then additional zero bytes are used to pad out the field. If
    <em>arg</em> is longer than the specified length, the extra characters will
    be ignored. If <em>count</em> is</p>
<p>then all of the bytes in <em>arg</em> will be formatted. If <em>count</em> is omitted,
then one character will be formatted. For example, the command:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>binary format</strong> a7a*a alpha bravo charlie</p>
<p>will return a binary string equivalent to:</p>
<p><strong>alpha\000\000bravoc</strong></p>
<p>the command:</p>
<p><strong>binary format</strong> a* [encoding convertto utf-8 \u20ac]</p>
<p>will return a binary string equivalent to:</p>
<p><strong>\342\202\254</strong></p>
<p>(which is the UTF-8 byte sequence for a Euro-currency character), and
the command:</p>
<p><strong>binary format</strong> a* [encoding convertto iso8859-15 \u20ac]</p>
<p>will return a binary string equivalent to:</p>
<p><strong>\244</strong></p>
<p>(which is the ISO 8859-15 byte sequence for a Euro-currency
character). Contrast these last two with:</p>
<p><strong>binary format</strong> a* \u20ac</p>
<p>which returns a binary string equivalent to:</p>
<p><strong>\254</strong></p>
<p>(i.e. <strong>\xac</strong>) by truncating the high-bits of the character, and
which is probably not what is desired.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A.  This form is the same as <strong>a</strong> except that spaces are used for
    padding instead of nulls. For example,</p>
<pre><code>**binary format** A6A\*A alpha bravo charlie

will return

**alpha bravoc**
</code></pre>
<pre><code>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>b.  Stores a string of <em>count</em> binary digits in low-to-high order within
    each byte in the output binary string. <em>Arg</em> must contain a sequence
    of <strong>1</strong> and <strong>0</strong> characters. The resulting bytes are emitted in
    first to last order with the bits being formatted in low-to-high
    order within each byte. If <em>arg</em> has fewer than <em>count</em> digits, then
    zeros will be used for the remaining bits. If <em>arg</em> has more than
    the specified number of digits, the extra digits will be ignored. If
    <em>count</em> is</p>
<p>then all of the digits in <em>arg</em> will be formatted. If <em>count</em> is
omitted, then one digit will be formatted. If the number of bits
formatted does not end at a byte boundary, the remaining bits of the
last byte will be zeros. For example,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>binary format</strong> b5b* 11100 111000011010</p>
<p>will return a binary string equivalent to:</p>
<p><strong>\x07\x87\x05</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>B.  This form is the same as <strong>b</strong> except that the bits are stored in
    high-to-low order within each byte. For example,</p>
<pre><code>**binary format** B5B\* 11100 111000011010

will return a binary string equivalent to:

**\\xe0\\xe1\\xa0**
</code></pre>
<p>C.  Stores a string of <em>count</em> hexadecimal digits in high-to-low within
    each byte in the output binary string. <em>Arg</em> must contain a sequence
    of characters in the set</p>
<p>The resulting bytes are emitted in first to last order with the hex
digits being formatted in high-to-low order within each byte. If <em>arg</em>
has fewer than <em>count</em> digits, then zeros will be used for the remaining
digits. If <em>arg</em> has more than the specified number of digits, the extra
digits will be ignored. If <em>count</em> is</p>
<p>then all of the digits in <em>arg</em> will be formatted. If <em>count</em> is
omitted, then one digit will be formatted. If the number of digits
formatted does not end at a byte boundary, the remaining bits of the
last byte will be zeros. For example,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>binary format</strong> H3H*H2 ab DEF 987</p>
<p>will return a binary string equivalent to:</p>
<p><strong>\xab\x00\xde\xf0\x98</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>h.  This form is the same as <strong>H</strong> except that the digits are stored in
    low-to-high order within each byte. This is seldom required. For
    example,</p>
<pre><code>**binary format** h3h\*h2 AB def 987

will return a binary string equivalent to:

**\\xba\\x00\\xed\\x0f\\x89**
</code></pre>
<p>i.  Stores one or more 8-bit integer values in the output string. If no
    <em>count</em> is specified, then <em>arg</em> must consist of an integer value.
    If <em>count</em> is specified, <em>arg</em> must consist of a list containing at
    least that many integers. The low-order 8 bits of each integer are
    stored as a one-byte value at the cursor position. If <em>count</em> is</p>
<p>then all of the integers in the list are formatted. If the number of
elements in the list is greater than <em>count</em>, then the extra elements
are ignored. For example,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>binary format</strong> c3cc* {3 -3 128 1} 260 {2 5}</p>
<p>will return a binary string equivalent to:</p>
<p><strong>\x03\xfd\x80\x04\x02\x05</strong></p>
<p>whereas:</p>
<p><strong>binary format</strong> c {2 5}</p>
<p>will generate an error.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>s.  This form is the same as <strong>c</strong> except that it stores one or more
    16-bit integers in little-endian byte order in the output string.
    The low-order 16-bits of each integer are stored as a two-byte value
    at the cursor position with the least significant byte stored first.
    For example,</p>
<pre><code>**binary format** s3 {3 -3 258 1}

will return a binary string equivalent to:

**\\x03\\x00\\xfd\\xff\\x02\\x01**
</code></pre>
<pre><code>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>S.  This form is the same as <strong>s</strong> except that it stores one or more
    16-bit integers in big-endian byte order in the output string. For
    example,</p>
<pre><code>**binary format** S3 {3 -3 258 1}

will return a binary string equivalent to:

**\\x00\\x03\\xff\\xfd\\x01\\x02**
</code></pre>
<pre><code>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>t.  This form (mnemonically <em>tiny</em>) is the same as <strong>s</strong> and <strong>S</strong>
    except that it stores the 16-bit integers in the output string in
    the native byte order of the machine where the Tcl script is
    running. To determine what the native byte order of the machine is,
    refer to the <strong>byteOrder</strong> element of the <strong>tcl_platform</strong> array.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>i.  This form is the same as <strong>c</strong> except that it stores one or more
    32-bit integers in little-endian byte order in the output string.
    The low-order 32-bits of each integer are stored as a four-byte
    value at the cursor position with the least significant byte stored
    first. For example,</p>
<pre><code>**binary format** i3 {3 -3 65536 1}

will return a binary string equivalent to:

**\\x03\\x00\\x00\\x00\\xfd\\xff\\xff\\xff\\x00\\x00\\x01\\x00**
</code></pre>
<pre><code>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>I.  This form is the same as <strong>i</strong> except that it stores one or more one
    or more 32-bit integers in big-endian byte order in the output
    string. For example,</p>
<pre><code>**binary format** I3 {3 -3 65536 1}

will return a binary string equivalent to:

**\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x03\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xfd\\x00\\x01\\x00\\x00**
</code></pre>
<pre><code>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>n.  This form (mnemonically <em>number</em> or <em>normal</em>) is the same as <strong>i</strong>
    and <strong>I</strong> except that it stores the 32-bit integers in the output
    string in the native byte order of the machine where the Tcl script
    is running. To determine what the native byte order of the machine
    is, refer to the <strong>byteOrder</strong> element of the <strong>tcl_platform</strong>
    array.</p>
<p>o.  This form is the same as <strong>c</strong> except that it stores one or more
    64-bit integers in little-endian byte order in the output string.
    The low-order 64-bits of each integer are stored as an eight-byte
    value at the cursor position with the least significant byte stored
    first. For example,</p>
<pre><code>**binary format** w 7810179016327718216

will return the binary string **HelloTcl**.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>W.  This form is the same as <strong>w</strong> except that it stores one or more one
    or more 64-bit integers in big-endian byte order in the output
    string. For example,</p>
<pre><code>**binary format** Wc 4785469626960341345 110

will return the binary string **BigEndian**
</code></pre>
<pre><code>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>m.  This form (mnemonically the mirror of <strong>w</strong>) is the same as <strong>w</strong>
    and <strong>W</strong> except that it stores the 64-bit integers in the output
    string in the native byte order of the machine where the Tcl script
    is running. To determine what the native byte order of the machine
    is, refer to the <strong>byteOrder</strong> element of the <strong>tcl_platform</strong>
    array.</p>
<p>n.  This form is the same as <strong>c</strong> except that it stores one or more one
    or more single-precision floating point numbers in the machine\'s
    native representation in the output string. This representation is
    not portable across architectures, so it should not be used to
    communicate floating point numbers across the network. The size of a
    floating point number may vary across architectures, so the number
    of bytes that are generated may vary. If the value overflows the
    machine\'s native representation, then the value of FLT_MAX as
    defined by the system will be used instead. Because Tcl uses
    double-precision floating point numbers internally, there may be
    some loss of precision in the conversion to single-precision. For
    example, on a Windows system running on an Intel Pentium processor,</p>
<pre><code>**binary format** f2 {1.6 3.4}

will return a binary string equivalent to:

**\\xcd\\xcc\\xcc\\x3f\\x9a\\x99\\x59\\x40**
</code></pre>
<p>o.  This form (mnemonically <em>real</em>) is the same as <strong>f</strong> except that it
    stores the single-precision floating point numbers in little-endian
    order. This conversion only produces meaningful output when used on
    machines which use the IEEE floating point representation (very
    common, but not universal.)</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>R.  This form is the same as <strong>r</strong> except that it stores the
    single-precision floating point numbers in big-endian order.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>d.  This form is the same as <strong>f</strong> except that it stores one or more one
    or more double-precision floating point numbers in the machine\'s
    native representation in the output string. For example, on a
    Windows system running on an Intel Pentium processor,</p>
<pre><code>**binary format** d1 {1.6}

will return a binary string equivalent to:

**\\x9a\\x99\\x99\\x99\\x99\\x99\\xf9\\x3f**
</code></pre>
<p>e.  This form (mnemonically the mirror of <strong>d</strong>) is the same as <strong>d</strong>
    except that it stores the double-precision floating point numbers in
    little-endian order. This conversion only produces meaningful output
    when used on machines which use the IEEE floating point
    representation (very common, but not universal.)</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Q.  This form is the same as <strong>q</strong> except that it stores the
    double-precision floating point numbers in big-endian order.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>x.  Stores <em>count</em> null bytes in the output string. If <em>count</em> is not
    specified, stores one null byte. If <em>count</em> is</p>
<p>generates an error. This type does not consume an argument. For example,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>binary format</strong> a3xa3x2a3 abc def ghi</p>
<p>will return a binary string equivalent to:</p>
<p><strong>abc\000def\000\000ghi</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>X.  Moves the cursor back <em>count</em> bytes in the output string. If <em>count</em>
    is</p>
<p>or is larger than the current cursor position, then the cursor is
positioned at location 0 so that the next byte stored will be the first
byte in the result string. If <em>count</em> is omitted then the cursor is
moved back one byte. This type does not consume an argument. For
example,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>binary format</strong> a3X*a3X2a3 abc def ghi</p>
<p>will return <strong>dghi</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Moves the cursor to the absolute location in the output string
    specified by <em>count</em>. Position 0 refers to the first byte in the
    output string. If <em>count</em> refers to a position beyond the last byte
    stored so far, then null bytes will be placed in the uninitialized
    locations and the cursor will be placed at the specified location.
    If <em>count</em> is</li>
</ol>
<p>then the cursor is moved to the current end of the output string. If
<em>count</em> is omitted, then an error will be generated. This type does not
consume an argument. For example,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>binary format</strong> a5@2a1@*a3@10a1 abcde f ghi j</p>
<p>will return</p>
<p><strong>abfdeghi\000\000j</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="binary-scan">BINARY SCAN</h1>
<p>The <strong>binary scan</strong> command parses fields from a binary string,
returning the number of conversions performed. <em>String</em> gives the input
bytes to be parsed and <em>formatString</em> indicates how to parse it. An
error is raised if <em>string</em> is anything other than a valid binary data
value. Each <em>varName</em> gives the name of a variable; when a field is
scanned from <em>string</em> the result is assigned to the corresponding
variable.</p>
<p>As with <strong>binary format</strong>, the <em>formatString</em> consists of a sequence of
zero or more field specifiers separated by zero or more spaces. Each
field specifier is a single type character followed by an optional flag
character followed by an optional numeric <em>count</em>. Most field specifiers
consume one argument to obtain the variable into which the scanned
values should be placed. The type character specifies how the binary
data is to be interpreted. The <em>count</em> typically indicates how many
items of the specified type are taken from the data. If present, the
<em>count</em> is a non-negative decimal integer or</p>
<p>which normally indicates that all of the remaining items in the data are
to be used. If there are not enough bytes left after the current cursor
position to satisfy the current field specifier, then the corresponding
variable is left untouched and <strong>binary scan</strong> returns immediately with
the number of variables that were set. If there are not enough arguments
for all of the fields in the format string that consume arguments, then
an error is generated. The flag character</p>
<p>may be given to cause some types to be read as unsigned values. The flag
is accepted for all field types but is ignored for non-integer fields.</p>
<p>A similar example as with <strong>binary format</strong> should explain the relation
between field specifiers and arguments in case of the binary scan
subcommand:</p>
<p><strong>binary scan</strong> \$bytes s3s first second</p>
<p>This command (provided the binary string in the variable <em>bytes</em> is long
enough) assigns a list of three integers to the variable <em>first</em> and
assigns a single value to the variable <em>second</em>. If <em>bytes</em> contains
fewer than 8 bytes (i.e. four 2-byte integers), no assignment to
<em>second</em> will be made, and if <em>bytes</em> contains fewer than 6 bytes (i.e.
three 2-byte integers), no assignment to <em>first</em> will be made. Hence:</p>
<p>puts [<strong>binary scan</strong> abcdefg s3s first second] puts \$first puts
\$second</p>
<p>will print (assuming neither variable is set previously):</p>
<p>1 25185 25699 26213 can\'t read \"second\": no such variable</p>
<p>It is <em>important</em> to note that the <strong>c</strong>, <strong>s</strong>, and <strong>S</strong> (and <strong>i</strong>
and <strong>I</strong> on 64bit systems) will be scanned into long data size values.
In doing this, values that have their high bit set (0x80 for chars,
0x8000 for shorts, 0x80000000 for ints), will be sign extended. Thus the
following will occur:</p>
<p>set signShort [<strong>binary format</strong> s1 0x8000] <strong>binary scan</strong>
\$signShort s1 val; <em># val == 0xFFFF8000</em></p>
<p>If you require unsigned values you can include the</p>
<p>flag character following the field type. For example, to read an
unsigned short value:</p>
<p>set signShort [<strong>binary format</strong> s1 0x8000] <strong>binary scan</strong>
\$signShort su1 val; <em># val == 0x00008000</em></p>
<p>Each type-count pair moves an imaginary cursor through the binary data,
reading bytes from the current position. The cursor is initially at
position 0 at the beginning of the data. The type may be any one of the
following characters:</p>
<p>a.  The data is a byte string of length <em>count</em>. If <em>count</em> is</p>
<p>then all of the remaining bytes in <em>string</em> will be scanned into the
variable. If <em>count</em> is omitted, then one byte will be scanned. All
bytes scanned will be interpreted as being characters in the range
\u0000-\u00ff so the <strong>encoding convertfrom</strong> command will be needed
if the string is not a binary string or a string encoded in ISO 8859-1.
For example,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>binary scan</strong> abcde\000fghi a6a10 var1 var2</p>
<p>will return <strong>1</strong> with the string equivalent to <strong>abcde\000</strong> stored
in <em>var1</em> and <em>var2</em> left unmodified, and</p>
<p><strong>binary scan</strong> \342\202\254 a* var1 set var2 [encoding
convertfrom utf-8 \$var1]</p>
<p>will store a Euro-currency character in <em>var2</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A.  This form is the same as <strong>a</strong>, except trailing blanks and nulls are
    stripped from the scanned value before it is stored in the variable.
    For example,</p>
<pre><code>**binary scan** \"abc efghi \\000\" A\* var1

will return **1** with **abc efghi** stored in *var1*.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>b.  The data is turned into a string of <em>count</em> binary digits in
    low-to-high order represented as a sequence of</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>characters. The data bytes are scanned in first to last order with the
bits being taken in low-to-high order within each byte. Any extra bits
in the last byte are ignored. If <em>count</em> is</p>
<p>then all of the remaining bits in <em>string</em> will be scanned. If <em>count</em>
is omitted, then one bit will be scanned. For example,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>binary scan</strong> \x07\x87\x05 b5b* var1 var2</p>
<p>will return <strong>2</strong> with <strong>11100</strong> stored in <em>var1</em> and
<strong>1110000110100000</strong> stored in <em>var2</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>B.  This form is the same as <strong>b</strong>, except the bits are taken in
    high-to-low order within each byte. For example,</p>
<pre><code>**binary scan** \\x70\\x87\\x05 B5B\* var1 var2

will return **2** with **01110** stored in *var1* and
**1000011100000101** stored in *var2*.
</code></pre>
<p>C.  This form is similar to <strong>A</strong>, except that it scans the data from
    start and terminates at the first null (C string semantics). For
    example,</p>
<pre><code>**binary scan** \"abc\\000efghi\" C\* var1

will return **1** with **abc** stored in *var1*.
</code></pre>
<p>D.  The data is turned into a string of <em>count</em> hexadecimal digits in
    high-to-low order represented as a sequence of characters in the set</p>
<p>The data bytes are scanned in first to last order with the hex digits
being taken in high-to-low order within each byte. Any extra bits in the
last byte are ignored. If <em>count</em> is</p>
<p>then all of the remaining hex digits in <em>string</em> will be scanned. If
<em>count</em> is omitted, then one hex digit will be scanned. For example,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>binary scan</strong> \x07\xC6\x05\x1f\x34 H3H* var1 var2</p>
<p>will return <strong>2</strong> with <strong>07c</strong> stored in <em>var1</em> and <strong>051f34</strong> stored
in <em>var2</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>h.  This form is the same as <strong>H</strong>, except the digits are taken in
    reverse (low-to-high) order within each byte. For example,</p>
<pre><code>**binary scan** \\x07\\x86\\x05\\x12\\x34 h3h\* var1 var2

will return **2** with **706** stored in *var1* and **502143**
stored in *var2*.

Note that most code that wishes to parse the hexadecimal digits from
multiple bytes in order should use the **H** format.
</code></pre>
<p>i.  The data is turned into <em>count</em> 8-bit signed integers and stored in
    the corresponding variable as a list, or as unsigned if <strong>u</strong> is
    placed immediately after the <strong>c</strong>. If <em>count</em> is</p>
<p>then all of the remaining bytes in <em>string</em> will be scanned. If <em>count</em>
is omitted, then one 8-bit integer will be scanned. For example,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>binary scan</strong> \x07\x86\x05 c2c* var1 var2</p>
<p>will return <strong>2</strong> with <strong>7 -122</strong> stored in <em>var1</em> and <strong>5</strong> stored in
<em>var2</em>. Note that the integers returned are signed unless <strong>cu</strong> in
place of <strong>c</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>s.  The data is interpreted as <em>count</em> 16-bit signed integers
    represented in little-endian byte order, or as unsigned if <strong>u</strong> is
    placed immediately after the <strong>s</strong>. The integers are stored in the
    corresponding variable as a list. If <em>count</em> is</p>
<p>then all of the remaining bytes in <em>string</em> will be scanned. If <em>count</em>
is omitted, then one 16-bit integer will be scanned. For example,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>binary scan</strong> \x05\x00\x07\x00\xf0\xff s2s* var1 var2</p>
<p>will return <strong>2</strong> with <strong>5 7</strong> stored in <em>var1</em> and <strong>-16</strong> stored in
<em>var2</em>. Note that the integers returned are signed unless <strong>su</strong> is
used in place of <strong>s</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>S.  This form is the same as <strong>s</strong> except that the data is interpreted
    as <em>count</em> 16-bit integers represented in big-endian byte order. For
    example,</p>
<pre><code>**binary scan** \\x00\\x05\\x00\\x07\\xff\\xf0 S2S\* var1 var2

will return **2** with **5 7** stored in *var1* and **-16** stored

<p>n.  The data is interpreted as <em>count</em> single-precision floating point
    numbers in the machine\'s native representation. The floating point
    numbers are stored in the corresponding variable as a list. If
    <em>count</em> is</p>
<p>then all of the remaining bytes in <em>string</em> will be scanned. If <em>count</em>
is omitted, then one single-precision floating point number will be
scanned. The size of a floating point number may vary across
architectures, so the number of bytes that are scanned may vary. If the
data does not represent a valid floating point number, the resulting
value is undefined and compiler dependent. For example, on a Windows
system running on an Intel Pentium processor,</p>

<p>x.  Moves the cursor forward <em>count</em> bytes in <em>string</em>. If <em>count</em> is</p>
<p>or is larger than the number of bytes after the current cursor position,
then the cursor is positioned after the last byte in <em>string</em>. If
<em>count</em> is omitted, then the cursor is moved forward one byte. Note that
this type does not consume an argument. For example,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>binary scan</strong> \x01\x02\x03\x04 x2H* var1</p>
<p>will return <strong>1</strong> with <strong>0304</strong> stored in <em>var1</em>.</p>

<p>X.  Moves the cursor back <em>count</em> bytes in <em>string</em>. If <em>count</em> is</p>
<p>or is larger than the current cursor position, then the cursor is
positioned at location 0 so that the next byte scanned will be the first
byte in <em>string</em>. If <em>count</em> is omitted then the cursor is moved back
one byte. Note that this type does not consume an argument. For example,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>binary scan</strong> \x01\x02\x03\x04 c2XH* var1 var2</p>
<p>will return <strong>2</strong> with <strong>1 2</strong> stored in <em>var1</em> and <strong>020304</strong> stored
in <em>var2</em>.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Moves the cursor to the absolute location in the data string
    specified by <em>count</em>. Note that position 0 refers to the first byte
    in <em>string</em>. If <em>count</em> refers to a position beyond the end of
    <em>string</em>, then the cursor is positioned after the last byte. If
    <em>count</em> is omitted, then an error will be generated. For example,</p>
<p><strong>binary scan</strong> \x01\x02\x03\x04 c2@1H* var1 var2</p>
<p>will return <strong>2</strong> with <strong>1 2</strong> stored in <em>var1</em> and <strong>020304</strong>

<h1 id="portability-issues">PORTABILITY ISSUES</h1>
<p>The <strong>r</strong>, <strong>R</strong>, <strong>q</strong> and <strong>Q</strong> conversions will only work reliably
for transferring data between computers which are all using IEEE
floating point representations. This is very common, but not universal.
To transfer floating-point numbers portably between all architectures,
use their textual representation (as produced by <strong>format</strong>) instead.</p>
<h1 id="examples">EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>This is a procedure to write a Tcl string to a binary-encoded channel as
UTF-8 data preceded by a length word:</p>
<p>proc <em>writeString</em> {channel string} { set data [encoding convertto
utf-8 \$string] puts -nonewline [<strong>binary format</strong> Ia* \ [string
length \$data] \$data] }</p>
<p>This procedure reads a string from a channel that was written by the
previously presented <em>writeString</em> procedure:</p>
<p>proc <em>readString</em> {channel} { if {![<strong>binary scan</strong> [read \$channel
4] I length]} { error \"missing length\" } set data [read \$channel
\$length] return [encoding convertfrom utf-8 \$data] }</p>
<p>This converts the contents of a file (named in the variable <em>filename</em>)
to base64 and prints them:</p>
<p>set f [open \$filename rb] set data [read \$f] close \$f puts
[<strong>binary encode</strong> base64 -maxlen 64 \$data]</p>
