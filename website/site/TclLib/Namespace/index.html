<h1 id="name">NAME</h1>
<p>namespace - create and manipulate contexts for commands and variables</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>namespace </strong>?<em>subcommand</em>? ?<em>arg ...</em>?</p>
<p>\</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>namespace</strong> command lets you create, access, and destroy separate
contexts for commands and variables. See the section <strong>WHAT IS A
NAMESPACE?</strong> below for a brief overview of namespaces. The legal values
of <em>subcommand</em> are listed below. Note that you can abbreviate the
<em>subcommand</em>s.</p>
<p><strong>namespace children </strong>?<em>namespace</em>? ?<em>pattern</em>?</p>
<p>:   Returns a list of all child namespaces that belong to the namespace
    <em>namespace</em>. If <em>namespace</em> is not specified, then the children are
    returned for the current namespace. This command returns
    fully-qualified names, which start with a double colon (<strong>::</strong>). If
    the optional <em>pattern</em> is given, then this command returns only the
    names that match the glob-style pattern. The actual pattern used is
    determined as follows: a pattern that starts with double colon
    (<strong>::</strong>) is used directly, otherwise the namespace <em>namespace</em> (or
    the fully-qualified name of the current namespace) is prepended onto
    the pattern.</p>
<p><strong>namespace code </strong><em>script</em></p>
<p>:   Captures the current namespace context for later execution of the
    script <em>script</em>. It returns a new script in which <em>script</em> has been
    wrapped in a <strong>namespace inscope</strong> command. The new script has two
    important properties. First, it can be evaluated in any namespace
    and will cause <em>script</em> to be evaluated in the current namespace
    (the one where the <strong>namespace code</strong> command was invoked). Second,
    additional arguments can be appended to the resulting script and
    they will be passed to <em>script</em> as additional arguments. For
    example, suppose the command <strong>set script [namespace code {foo
    bar}]</strong> is invoked in namespace <strong>::a::b</strong>. Then <strong>eval \$script
    [list x y]</strong> can be executed in any namespace (assuming the value
    of <strong>script</strong> has been passed in properly) and will have the same
    effect as the command <strong>::namespace eval ::a::b {foo bar x y}</strong>.
    This command is needed because extensions like Tk normally execute
    callback scripts in the global namespace. A scoped command captures
    a command together with its namespace context in a way that allows
    it to be executed properly later. See the section <strong>SCOPED SCRIPTS</strong>
    for some examples of how this is used to create callback scripts.</p>
<p><strong>namespace current</strong></p>
<p>:   Returns the fully-qualified name for the current namespace. The
    actual name of the global namespace is (i.e., an empty string), but
    this command returns <strong>::</strong> for the global namespace as a
    convenience to programmers.</p>
<p><strong>namespace delete </strong>?<em>namespace namespace ...</em>?</p>
<p>:   Each namespace <em>namespace</em> is deleted and all variables, procedures,
    and child namespaces contained in the namespace are deleted. If a
    procedure is currently executing inside the namespace, the namespace
    will be kept alive until the procedure returns; however, the
    namespace is marked to prevent other code from looking it up by
    name. If a namespace does not exist, this command returns an error.
    If no namespace names are given, this command does nothing.</p>
<p><strong>namespace ensemble</strong> <em>subcommand</em> ?<em>arg ...</em>?</p>
<p>:   Creates and manipulates a command that is formed out of an ensemble
    of subcommands. See the section <strong>ENSEMBLES</strong> below for further
    details.</p>
<p><strong>namespace eval</strong> <em>namespace arg</em> ?<em>arg ...</em>?</p>
<p>:   Activates a namespace called <em>namespace</em> and evaluates some code in
    that context. If the namespace does not already exist, it is
    created. If more than one <em>arg</em> argument is specified, the arguments
    are concatenated together with a space between each one in the same
    fashion as the <strong>eval</strong> command, and the result is evaluated.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>If *namespace* has leading namespace qualifiers and any leading
namespaces do not exist, they are automatically created.
</code></pre></div>
<p><strong>namespace exists</strong> <em>namespace</em></p>
<p>:   Returns <strong>1</strong> if <em>namespace</em> is a valid namespace in the current
    context, returns <strong>0</strong> otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>namespace export </strong>?<strong>-clear</strong>? ?<em>pattern pattern ...</em>?</p>
<p>:   Specifies which commands are exported from a namespace. The exported
    commands are those that can be later imported into another namespace
    using a <strong>namespace import</strong> command. Both commands defined in a
    namespace and commands the namespace has previously imported can be
    exported by a namespace. The commands do not have to be defined at
    the time the <strong>namespace export</strong> command is executed. Each
    <em>pattern</em> may contain glob-style special characters, but it may not
    include any namespace qualifiers. That is, the pattern can only
    specify commands in the current (exporting) namespace. Each
    <em>pattern</em> is appended onto the namespace\'s list of export patterns.
    If the <strong>-clear</strong> flag is given, the namespace\'s export pattern
    list is reset to empty before any <em>pattern</em> arguments are appended.
    If no <em>pattern</em>s are given and the <strong>-clear</strong> flag is not given,
    this command returns the namespace\'s current export list.</p>
<p><strong>namespace forget </strong>?<em>pattern pattern ...</em>?</p>
<p>:   Removes previously imported commands from a namespace. Each
    <em>pattern</em> is a simple or qualified name such as <strong>x</strong>, <strong>foo::x</strong> or
    <strong>a::b::p*</strong>. Qualified names contain double colons (<strong>::</strong>) and
    qualify a name with the name of one or more namespaces. Each is
    qualified with the name of an exporting namespace and may have
    glob-style special characters in the command name at the end of the
    qualified name. Glob characters may not appear in a namespace name.
    For each this command deletes the matching commands of the current
    namespace that were imported from a different namespace. For this
    command first finds the matching exported commands. It then checks
    whether any of those commands were previously imported by the
    current namespace. If so, this command deletes the corresponding
    imported commands. In effect, this un-does the action of a
    <strong>namespace import</strong> command.</p>
<p><strong>namespace import </strong>?<strong>-force</strong>? ?<em>pattern</em> <em>pattern ...</em>?</p>
<p>:   Imports commands into a namespace, or queries the set of imported
    commands in a namespace. When no arguments are present, <strong>namespace
    import</strong> returns the list of commands in the current namespace that
    have been imported from other namespaces. The commands in the
    returned list are in the format of simple names, with no namespace
    qualifiers at all. This format is suitable for composition with
    <strong>namespace forget</strong> (see <strong>EXAMPLES</strong> below).</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>When *pattern* arguments are present, each *pattern* is a qualified
name like **foo::x** or **a::p\***. That is, it includes the name of
an exporting namespace and may have glob-style special characters in
the command name at the end of the qualified name. Glob characters
may not appear in a namespace name. When the namespace name is not
fully qualified (i.e., does not start with a namespace separator) it
is resolved as a namespace name in the way described in the **NAME
RESOLUTION** section; it is an error if no namespace with that name
can be found.

All the commands that match a *pattern* string and which are
currently exported from their namespace are added to the current
namespace. This is done by creating a new command in the current
namespace that points to the exported command in its original
namespace; when the new imported command is called, it invokes the
exported command. This command normally returns an error if an
imported command conflicts with an existing command. However, if the
**-force** option is given, imported commands will silently replace
existing commands. The **namespace import** command has snapshot
semantics: that is, only requested commands that are currently
defined in the exporting namespace are imported. In other words, you
can import only the commands that are in a namespace at the time
when the **namespace import** command is executed. If another
command is defined and exported in this namespace later on, it will
not be imported.
</code></pre></div>
<p><strong>namespace inscope</strong> <em>namespace</em> <em>script</em> ?<em>arg ...</em>?</p>
<p>:   Executes a script in the context of the specified <em>namespace</em>. This
    command is not expected to be used directly by programmers; calls to
    it are generated implicitly when applications use <strong>namespace code</strong>
    commands to create callback scripts that the applications then
    register with, e.g., Tk widgets. The <strong>namespace inscope</strong> command
    is much like the <strong>namespace eval</strong> command except that the
    <em>namespace</em> must already exist, and <strong>namespace inscope</strong> appends
    additional <em>arg</em>s as proper list elements.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>    namespace inscope ::foo $script $x $y $z

is equivalent to

    namespace eval ::foo [concat $script [list $x $y $z]]

thus additional arguments will not undergo a second round of
substitution, as is the case with **namespace eval**.
</code></pre></div>
<p><strong>namespace origin </strong><em>command</em></p>
<p>:   Returns the fully-qualified name of the original command to which
    the imported command <em>command</em> refers. When a command is imported
    into a namespace, a new command is created in that namespace that
    points to the actual command in the exporting namespace. If a
    command is imported into a sequence of namespaces <em>a, b,...,n</em>
    where each successive namespace just imports the command from the
    previous namespace, this command returns the fully-qualified name of
    the original command in the first namespace, <em>a</em>. If <em>command</em> does
    not refer to an imported command, the command\'s own fully-qualified
    name is returned.</p>
<p><strong>namespace parent</strong> ?<em>namespace</em>?</p>
<p>:   Returns the fully-qualified name of the parent namespace for
    namespace <em>namespace</em>. If <em>namespace</em> is not specified, the
    fully-qualified name of the current namespace\'s parent is returned.</p>
<p><strong>namespace path</strong> ?<em>namespaceList</em>?</p>
<p>:   Returns the command resolution path of the current namespace. If
    <em>namespaceList</em> is specified as a list of named namespaces, the
    current namespace\'s command resolution path is set to those
    namespaces and returns the empty list. The default command
    resolution path is always empty. See the section <strong>NAME RESOLUTION</strong>
    below for an explanation of the rules regarding name resolution.</p>
<p><strong>namespace qualifiers</strong> <em>string</em></p>
<p>:   Returns any leading namespace qualifiers for <em>string</em>. Qualifiers
    are namespace names separated by double colons (<strong>::</strong>). For the
    <em>string</em> <strong>::foo::bar::x</strong>, this command returns <strong>::foo::bar</strong>, and
    for <strong>::</strong> it returns an empty string. This command is the
    complement of the <strong>namespace tail</strong> command. Note that it does not
    check whether the namespace names are, in fact, the names of
    currently defined namespaces.</p>
<p><strong>namespace tail</strong> <em>string</em></p>
<p>:   Returns the simple name at the end of a qualified string. Qualifiers
    are namespace names separated by double colons (<strong>::</strong>). For the
    <em>string</em> <strong>::foo::bar::x</strong>, this command returns <strong>x</strong>, and for
    <strong>::</strong> it returns an empty string. This command is the complement of
    the <strong>namespace qualifiers</strong> command. It does not check whether the
    namespace names are, in fact, the names of currently defined
    namespaces.</p>
<p><strong>namespace upvar</strong> <em>namespace</em> ?<em>otherVar myVar </em>...?</p>
<p>:   This command arranges for zero or more local variables in the
    current procedure to refer to variables in <em>namespace</em>. The
    namespace name is resolved as described in section <strong>NAME
    RESOLUTION</strong>. The command <strong>namespace upvar \$ns a b</strong> has the same
    behaviour as <strong>upvar 0 \${ns}::a b</strong>, with the sole exception of the
    resolution rules used for qualified namespace or variable names.
    <strong>namespace upvar</strong> returns an empty string.</p>
<p><strong>namespace unknown</strong> ?<em>script</em>?</p>
<p>:   Sets or returns the unknown command handler for the current
    namespace. The handler is invoked when a command called from within
    the namespace cannot be found in the current namespace, the
    namespace\'s path nor in the global namespace. The <em>script</em>
    argument, if given, should be a well formed list representing a
    command name and optional arguments. When the handler is invoked,
    the full invocation line will be appended to the script and the
    result evaluated in the context of the namespace. The default
    handler for all namespaces is <strong>::unknown</strong>. If no argument is
    given, it returns the handler for the current namespace.</p>
<p><strong>namespace which</strong> ?<strong>-command</strong>? ?<strong>-variable</strong>? <em>name</em></p>
<p>:   Looks up <em>name</em> as either a command or variable and returns its
    fully-qualified name. For example, if <em>name</em> does not exist in the
    current namespace but does exist in the global namespace, this
    command returns a fully-qualified name in the global namespace. If
    the command or variable does not exist, this command returns an
    empty string. If the variable has been created but not defined, such
    as with the <strong>variable</strong> command or through a <strong>trace</strong> on the
    variable, this command will return the fully-qualified name of the
    variable. If no flag is given, <em>name</em> is treated as a command name.
    See the section <strong>NAME RESOLUTION</strong> below for an explanation of the
    rules regarding name resolution.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-a-namespace">WHAT IS A NAMESPACE?</h1>
<p>A namespace is a collection of commands and variables. It encapsulates
the commands and variables to ensure that they will not interfere with
the commands and variables of other namespaces. Tcl has always had one
such collection, which we refer to as the <em>global namespace</em>. The global
namespace holds all global variables and commands. The <strong>namespace
eval</strong> command lets you create new namespaces. For example,</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>namespace eval Counter {
    namespace export bump
    variable num 0

    proc bump {} {
        variable num
        incr num
    }
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>creates a new namespace containing the variable <strong>num</strong> and the
procedure <strong>bump</strong>. The commands and variables in this namespace are
separate from other commands and variables in the same program. If there
is a command named <strong>bump</strong> in the global namespace, for example, it
will be different from the command <strong>bump</strong> in the <strong>Counter</strong>
namespace.</p>
<p>Namespace variables resemble global variables in Tcl. They exist outside
of the procedures in a namespace but can be accessed in a procedure via
the <strong>variable</strong> command, as shown in the example above.</p>
<p>Namespaces are dynamic. You can add and delete commands and variables at
any time, so you can build up the contents of a namespace over time
using a series of <strong>namespace eval</strong> commands. For example, the
following series of commands has the same effect as the namespace
definition shown above:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>namespace eval Counter {
    variable num 0
    proc bump {} {
        variable num
        return [incr num]
    }
}
namespace eval Counter {
    proc test {args} {
        return $args
    }
}
namespace eval Counter {
     rename test &quot;&quot;
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>Note that the <strong>test</strong> procedure is added to the <strong>Counter</strong> namespace,
and later removed via the <strong>rename</strong> command.</p>
<p>Namespaces can have other namespaces within them, so they nest
hierarchically. A nested namespace is encapsulated inside its parent
namespace and can not interfere with other namespaces.</p>
<h1 id="qualified-names">QUALIFIED NAMES</h1>
<p>Each namespace has a textual name such as <strong>history</strong> or
<strong>::safe::interp</strong>. Since namespaces may nest, qualified names are used
to refer to commands, variables, and child namespaces contained inside
namespaces. Qualified names are similar to the hierarchical path names
for Unix files or Tk widgets, except that <strong>::</strong> is used as the
separator instead of <strong>/</strong> or <strong>.</strong>. The topmost or global namespace has
the name (i.e., an empty string), although <strong>::</strong> is a synonym. As an
example, the name <strong>::safe::interp::create</strong> refers to the command
<strong>create</strong> in the namespace <strong>interp</strong> that is a child of namespace
<strong>::safe</strong>, which in turn is a child of the global namespace, <strong>::</strong>.</p>
<p>If you want to access commands and variables from another namespace, you
must use some extra syntax. Names must be qualified by the namespace
that contains them. From the global namespace, we might access the
<strong>Counter</strong> procedures like this:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Counter::bump 5
Counter::Reset
</code></pre></div>
<p>We could access the current count like this:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>puts &quot;count = $Counter::num&quot;
</code></pre></div>
<p>When one namespace contains another, you may need more than one
qualifier to reach its elements. If we had a namespace <strong>Foo</strong> that
contained the namespace <strong>Counter</strong>, you could invoke its <strong>bump</strong>
procedure from the global namespace like this:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Foo::Counter::bump 3
</code></pre></div>
<p>You can also use qualified names when you create and rename commands.
For example, you could add a procedure to the <strong>Foo</strong> namespace like
this:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>proc Foo::Test {args} {return $args}
</code></pre></div>
<p>And you could move the same procedure to another namespace like this:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>rename Foo::Test Bar::Test
</code></pre></div>
<p>There are a few remaining points about qualified names that we should
cover. Namespaces have nonempty names except for the global namespace.
<strong>::</strong> is disallowed in simple command, variable, and namespace names
except as a namespace separator. Extra colons in any separator part of a
qualified name are ignored; i.e. two or more colons are treated as a
namespace separator. A trailing <strong>::</strong> in a qualified variable or
command name refers to the variable or command named {}. However, a
trailing <strong>::</strong> in a qualified namespace name is ignored.</p>
<h1 id="name-resolution">NAME RESOLUTION</h1>
<p>In general, all Tcl commands that take variable and command names
support qualified names. This means you can give qualified names to such
commands as <strong>set</strong>, <strong>proc</strong>, <strong>rename</strong>, and <strong>interp alias</strong>. If you
provide a fully-qualified name that starts with a <strong>::</strong>, there is no
question about what command, variable, or namespace you mean. However,
if the name does not start with a <strong>::</strong> (i.e., is <em>relative</em>), Tcl
follows basic rules for looking it up:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Variable names</strong> are always resolved by looking first in the
    current namespace, and then in the global namespace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Command names</strong> are always resolved by looking in the current
    namespace first. If not found there, they are searched for in every
    namespace on the current namespace\'s command path (which is empty
    by default). If not found there, command names are looked up in the
    global namespace (or, failing that, are processed by the appropriate
    <strong>namespace unknown</strong> handler.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Namespace names</strong> are always resolved by looking in only the
    current namespace.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the following example,</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>set traceLevel 0
namespace eval Debug {
    printTrace $traceLevel
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>Tcl looks for <strong>traceLevel</strong> in the namespace <strong>Debug</strong> and then in the
global namespace. It looks up the command <strong>printTrace</strong> in the same
way. If a variable or command name is not found in either context, the
name is undefined. To make this point absolutely clear, consider the
following example:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>set traceLevel 0
namespace eval Foo {
    variable traceLevel 3

    namespace eval Debug {
        printTrace $traceLevel
    }
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here Tcl looks for <strong>traceLevel</strong> first in the namespace <strong>Foo::Debug</strong>.
Since it is not found there, Tcl then looks for it in the global
namespace. The variable <strong>Foo::traceLevel</strong> is completely ignored during
the name resolution process.</p>
<p>You can use the <strong>namespace which</strong> command to clear up any question
about name resolution. For example, the command:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>namespace eval Foo::Debug {namespace which -variable traceLevel}
</code></pre></div>
<p>returns <strong>::traceLevel</strong>. On the other hand, the command,</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>namespace eval Foo {namespace which -variable traceLevel}
</code></pre></div>
<p>returns <strong>::Foo::traceLevel</strong>.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, namespace names are looked up differently than the
names of variables and commands. Namespace names are always resolved in
the current namespace. This means, for example, that a <strong>namespace
eval</strong> command that creates a new namespace always creates a child of
the current namespace unless the new namespace name begins with <strong>::</strong>.</p>
<p>Tcl has no access control to limit what variables, commands, or
namespaces you can reference. If you provide a qualified name that
resolves to an element by the name resolution rule above, you can access
the element.</p>
<p>You can access a namespace variable from a procedure in the same
namespace by using the <strong>variable</strong> command. Much like the <strong>global</strong>
command, this creates a local link to the namespace variable. If
necessary, it also creates the variable in the current namespace and
initializes it. Note that the <strong>global</strong> command only creates links to
variables in the global namespace. It is not necessary to use a
<strong>variable</strong> command if you always refer to the namespace variable using
an appropriate qualified name.</p>
<h1 id="importing-commands">IMPORTING COMMANDS</h1>
<p>Namespaces are often used to represent libraries. Some library commands
are used so frequently that it is a nuisance to type their qualified
names. For example, suppose that all of the commands in a package like
BLT are contained in a namespace called <strong>Blt</strong>. Then you might access
these commands like this:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Blt::graph .g -background red
Blt::table . .g 0,0
</code></pre></div>
<p>If you use the <strong>graph</strong> and <strong>table</strong> commands frequently, you may want
to access them without the <strong>Blt::</strong> prefix. You can do this by
importing the commands into the current namespace, like this:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>namespace import Blt::*
</code></pre></div>
<p>This adds all exported commands from the <strong>Blt</strong> namespace into the
current namespace context, so you can write code like this:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>graph .g -background red
table . .g 0,0
</code></pre></div>
<p>The <strong>namespace import</strong> command only imports commands from a namespace
that that namespace exported with a <strong>namespace export</strong> command.</p>
<p>Importing <em>every</em> command from a namespace is generally a bad idea since
you do not know what you will get. It is better to import just the
specific commands you need. For example, the command</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>namespace import Blt::graph Blt::table
</code></pre></div>
<p>imports only the <strong>graph</strong> and <strong>table</strong> commands into the current
context.</p>
<p>If you try to import a command that already exists, you will get an
error. This prevents you from importing the same command from two
different packages. But from time to time (perhaps when debugging), you
may want to get around this restriction. You may want to reissue the
<strong>namespace import</strong> command to pick up new commands that have appeared
in a namespace. In that case, you can use the <strong>-force</strong> option, and
existing commands will be silently overwritten:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>namespace import -force Blt::graph Blt::table
</code></pre></div>
<p>If for some reason, you want to stop using the imported commands, you
can remove them with a <strong>namespace forget</strong> command, like this:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>namespace forget Blt::*
</code></pre></div>
<p>This searches the current namespace for any commands imported from
<strong>Blt</strong>. If it finds any, it removes them. Otherwise, it does nothing.
After this, the <strong>Blt</strong> commands must be accessed with the <strong>Blt::</strong>
prefix.</p>
<p>When you delete a command from the exporting namespace like this:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>rename Blt::graph &quot;&quot;
</code></pre></div>
<p>the command is automatically removed from all namespaces that import it.</p>
<h1 id="exporting-commands">EXPORTING COMMANDS</h1>
<p>You can export commands from a namespace like this:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>namespace eval Counter {
    namespace export bump reset
    variable Num 0
    variable Max 100

    proc bump {{by 1}} {
        variable Num
        incr Num $by
        Check
        return $Num
    }
    proc reset {} {
        variable Num
        set Num 0
    }
    proc Check {} {
        variable Num
        variable Max
        if {$Num &gt; $Max} {
            error &quot;too high!&quot;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>The procedures <strong>bump</strong> and <strong>reset</strong> are exported, so they are included
when you import from the <strong>Counter</strong> namespace, like this:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>namespace import Counter::*
</code></pre></div>
<p>However, the <strong>Check</strong> procedure is not exported, so it is ignored by
the import operation.</p>
<p>The <strong>namespace import</strong> command only imports commands that were
declared as exported by their namespace. The <strong>namespace export</strong>
command specifies what commands may be imported by other namespaces. If
a <strong>namespace import</strong> command specifies a command that is not exported,
the command is not imported.</p>
<h1 id="scoped-scripts">SCOPED SCRIPTS</h1>
<p>The <strong>namespace code</strong> command is the means by which a script may be
packaged for evaluation in a namespace other than the one in which it
was created. It is used most often to create event handlers, Tk
bindings, and traces for evaluation in the global context. For instance,
the following code indicates how to direct a variable <strong>trace</strong> callback
into the current namespace:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>namespace eval a {
    variable b
    proc theTraceCallback { n1 n2 op } {
        upvar 1 $n1 var
        puts &quot;the value of $n1 has changed to $var&quot;
        return
    }
    trace add variable b write [namespace code theTraceCallback]
}
set a::b c
</code></pre></div>
<p>When executed, it prints the message:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>the value of a::b has changed to c
</code></pre></div>
<h1 id="ensembles">ENSEMBLES</h1>
<p>The <strong>namespace ensemble</strong> is used to create and manipulate ensemble
commands, which are commands formed by grouping subcommands together.
The commands typically come from the current namespace when the ensemble
was created, though this is configurable. Note that there may be any
number of ensembles associated with any namespace (including none, which
is true of all namespaces by default), though all the ensembles
associated with a namespace are deleted when that namespace is deleted.
The link between an ensemble command and its namespace is maintained
however the ensemble is renamed.</p>
<p>Three subcommands of the <strong>namespace ensemble</strong> command are defined:</p>
<p><strong>namespace ensemble create</strong> ?<em>option value ...</em>?</p>
<p>:   Creates a new ensemble command linked to the current namespace,
    returning the fully qualified name of the command created. The
    arguments to <strong>namespace ensemble create</strong> allow the configuration
    of the command as if with the <strong>namespace ensemble configure</strong>
    command. If not overridden with the <strong>-command</strong> option, this
    command creates an ensemble with exactly the same name as the linked
    namespace. See the section <strong>ENSEMBLE OPTIONS</strong> below for a full
    list of options supported and their effects.</p>
<p><strong>namespace ensemble configure </strong><em>command</em> ?<em>option</em>? ?<em>value ...</em>?</p>
<p>:   Retrieves the value of an option associated with the ensemble
    command named <em>command</em>, or updates some options associated with
    that ensemble command. See the section <strong>ENSEMBLE OPTIONS</strong> below
    for a full list of options supported and their effects.</p>
<p><strong>namespace ensemble exists</strong> <em>command</em></p>
<p>:   Returns a boolean value that describes whether the command <em>command</em>
    exists and is an ensemble command. This command only ever returns an
    error if the number of arguments to the command is wrong.</p>
<p>When called, an ensemble command takes its first argument and looks it
up (according to the rules described below) to discover a list of words
to replace the ensemble command and subcommand with. The resulting list
of words is then evaluated (with no further substitutions) as if that
was what was typed originally (i.e. by passing the list of words through
<strong>Tcl_EvalObjv</strong>) and returning the result of the command. Note that it
is legal to make the target of an ensemble rewrite be another (or even
the same) ensemble command. The ensemble command will not be visible
through the use of the <strong>uplevel</strong> or <strong>info level</strong> commands.</p>
<h2 id="ensemble-options">ENSEMBLE OPTIONS</h2>
<p>The following options, supported by the <strong>namespace ensemble</strong> create
and <strong>namespace ensemble configure</strong> commands, control how an ensemble
command behaves:</p>
<p><strong>-map</strong></p>
<p>:   When non-empty, this option supplies a dictionary that provides a
    mapping from subcommand names to a list of prefix words to
    substitute in place of the ensemble command and subcommand words (in
    a manner similar to an alias created with <strong>interp alias</strong>; the
    words are not reparsed after substitution); if the first word of any
    target is not fully qualified when set, it is assumed to be relative
    to the <em>current</em> namespace and changed to be exactly that (that is,
    it is always fully qualified when read). When this option is empty,
    the mapping will be from the local name of the subcommand to its
    fully-qualified name. Note that when this option is non-empty and
    the <strong>-subcommands</strong> option is empty, the ensemble subcommand names
    will be exactly those words that have mappings in the dictionary.</p>
<p><strong>-parameters</strong></p>
<p>:   </p>
<p>This option gives a list of named arguments (the names being used during
generation of error messages) that are passed by the caller of the
ensemble between the name of the ensemble and the subcommand argument.
By default, it is the empty list.</p>
<p><strong>-prefixes</strong></p>
<p>:   This option (which is enabled by default) controls whether the
    ensemble command recognizes unambiguous prefixes of its subcommands.
    When turned off, the ensemble command requires exact matching of
    subcommand names.</p>
<p><strong>-subcommands</strong></p>
<p>:   When non-empty, this option lists exactly what subcommands are in
    the ensemble. The mapping for each of those commands will be either
    whatever is defined in the <strong>-map</strong> option, or to the command with
    the same name in the namespace linked to the ensemble. If this
    option is empty, the subcommands of the namespace will either be the
    keys of the dictionary listed in the <strong>-map</strong> option or the exported
    commands of the linked namespace at the time of the invocation of
    the ensemble command.</p>
<p><strong>-unknown</strong></p>
<p>:   When non-empty, this option provides a partial command (to which all
    the words that are arguments to the ensemble command, including the
    fully-qualified name of the ensemble, are appended) to handle the
    case where an ensemble subcommand is not recognized and would
    otherwise generate an error. When empty (the default) an error (in
    the style of <strong>Tcl_GetIndexFromObj</strong>) is generated whenever the
    ensemble is unable to determine how to implement a particular
    subcommand. See <strong>UNKNOWN HANDLER BEHAVIOUR</strong> for more details.</p>
<p>The following extra option is allowed by <strong>namespace ensemble</strong> create:</p>
<p><strong>-command</strong></p>
<p>:   This write-only option allows the name of the ensemble created by
    <strong>namespace ensemble create</strong> to be anything in any existing
    namespace. The default value for this option is the fully-qualified
    name of the namespace in which the <strong>namespace ensemble create</strong>
    command is invoked.</p>
<p>The following extra option is allowed by <strong>namespace ensemble</strong>
configure:</p>
<p><strong>-namespace</strong></p>
<p>:   This read-only option allows the retrieval of the fully-qualified
    name of the namespace which the ensemble was created within.</p>
<h2 id="unknown-handler-behaviour">UNKNOWN HANDLER BEHAVIOUR</h2>
<p>If an unknown handler is specified for an ensemble, that handler is
called when the ensemble command would otherwise return an error due to
it being unable to decide which subcommand to invoke. The exact
conditions under which that occurs are controlled by the
<strong>-subcommands</strong>, <strong>-map</strong> and <strong>-prefixes</strong> options as described above.</p>
<p>To execute the unknown handler, the ensemble mechanism takes the
specified <strong>-unknown</strong> option and appends each argument of the attempted
ensemble command invocation (including the ensemble command itself,
expressed as a fully qualified name). It invokes the resulting command
in the scope of the attempted call. If the execution of the unknown
handler terminates normally, the ensemble engine reparses the subcommand
(as described below) and tries to dispatch it again, which is ideal for
when the ensemble\'s configuration has been updated by the unknown
subcommand handler. Any other kind of termination of the unknown handler
is treated as an error.</p>
<p>The result of the unknown handler is expected to be a list (it is an
error if it is not). If the list is an empty list, the ensemble command
attempts to look up the original subcommand again and, if it is not
found this time, an error will be generated just as if the <strong>-unknown</strong>
handler was not there (i.e. for any particular invocation of an
ensemble, its unknown handler will be called at most once.) This makes
it easy for the unknown handler to update the ensemble or its backing
namespace so as to provide an implementation of the desired subcommand
and reparse.</p>
<p>When the result is a non-empty list, the words of that list are used to
replace the ensemble command and subcommand, just as if they had been
looked up in the <strong>-map</strong>. It is up to the unknown handler to supply all
namespace qualifiers if the implementing subcommand is not in the
namespace of the caller of the ensemble command. Also note that when
ensemble commands are chained (e.g. if you make one of the commands that
implement an ensemble subcommand into an ensemble, in a manner similar
to the <strong>text</strong> widget\'s tag and mark subcommands) then the rewrite
happens in the context of the caller of the outermost ensemble. That is
to say that ensembles do not in themselves place any namespace contexts
on the Tcl call stack.</p>
<p>Where an empty <strong>-unknown</strong> handler is given (the default), the ensemble
command will generate an error message based on the list of commands
that the ensemble has defined (formatted similarly to the error message
from <strong>Tcl_GetIndexFromObj</strong>). This is the error that will be thrown
when the subcommand is still not recognized during reparsing. It is also
an error for an <strong>-unknown</strong> handler to delete its namespace.</p>
<h1 id="examples">EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>Create a namespace containing a variable and an exported command:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>namespace eval foo {
    variable bar 0
    proc grill {} {
        variable bar
        puts &quot;called [incr bar] times&quot;
    }
    namespace export grill
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>Call the command defined in the previous example in various ways.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code># Direct call
::foo::grill

# Use the command resolution path to find the name
namespace eval boo {
    namespace path ::foo
    grill
}

# Import into current namespace, then call local alias
namespace import foo::grill
grill

# Create two ensembles, one with the default name and one with a
# specified name.  Then call through the ensembles.
namespace eval foo {
    namespace ensemble create
    namespace ensemble create -command ::foobar
}
foo grill
foobar grill
</code></pre></div>
<p>Look up where the command imported in the previous example came from:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>puts &quot;grill came from [namespace origin grill]&quot;
</code></pre></div>
<p>Remove all imported commands from the current namespace:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>namespace forget {*}[namespace import]
</code></pre></div>
<p>Create an ensemble for simple working with numbers, using the
<strong>-parameters</strong> option to allow the operator to be put between the first
and second arguments.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>namespace eval do {
    namespace export *
    namespace ensemble create -parameters x
    proc plus  {x y} {expr { $x + $y }}
    proc minus {x y} {expr { $x - $y }}
}

# In use, the ensemble works like this:
puts [do 1 plus [do 9 minus 7]]
</code></pre></div>
