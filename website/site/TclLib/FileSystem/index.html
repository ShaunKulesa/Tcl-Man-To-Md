<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>There are several reasons for calling the <strong>Tcl_FS</strong> API functions (e.g.
<strong>Tcl_FSAccess</strong> and <strong>Tcl_FSStat</strong>) rather than calling system level
functions like <strong>access</strong> and <strong>stat</strong> directly. First, they will work
cross-platform, so an extension which calls them should work unmodified
on Unix and Windows. Second, the Windows implementation of some of these
functions fixes some bugs in the system level calls. Third, these
function calls deal with any path conversions which may be required (and
may cache the results of such conversions for greater efficiency on
subsequent calls). Fourth, and perhaps most importantly, all of these
functions are Any virtual filesystem (VFS for short) which has been
registered (through <strong>Tcl_FSRegister</strong>) may reroute file access to
alternative media or access methods. This means that all of these
functions (and therefore the corresponding <strong>file</strong>, <strong>glob</strong>, <strong>pwd</strong>,
<strong>cd</strong>, <strong>open</strong>, etc. Tcl commands) may be operate on which are not
native files in the native filesystem. This also means that any Tcl
extension which accesses the filesystem (FS for short) through this API
is automatically Of course, if an extension accesses the native
filesystem directly (through platform-specific APIs, for example), then
Tcl cannot intercept such calls.</p>
<p>If appropriate VFSes have been registered, the may, to give two
examples, be remote (e.g. situated on a remote ftp server) or archived
(e.g. lying inside a .zip archive). Such registered filesystems provide
a lookup table of functions to implement all or some of the
functionality listed here. Finally, the <strong>Tcl_FSStat</strong> and
<strong>Tcl_FSLstat</strong> calls abstract away from what the buffer is actually
declared to be, allowing the same code to be used both on systems with
and systems without support for files larger than 2GB in size.</p>
<p>The <strong>Tcl_FS</strong> API is <strong>Tcl_Obj</strong>-ified and may cache internal
representations and other path-related strings (e.g. the current working
directory). One side-effect of this is that one must not pass in values
with a reference count of zero to any of these functions. If such calls
were handled, they might result in memory leaks (under some
circumstances, the filesystem code may wish to retain a reference to the
passed in value, and so one must not assume that after any of these
calls return, the value still has a reference count of zero - it may
have been incremented) or in a direct segmentation fault (or other
memory access error) due to the value being freed part way through the
complex value manipulation required to ensure that the path is fully
normalized and absolute for filesystem determination. The practical
lesson to learn from this is that</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Tcl_Obj *path = Tcl_NewStringObj(...);
Tcl_FSWhatever(path);
Tcl_DecrRefCount(path);
</code></pre></div>
<p>is wrong, and may cause memory errors. The <em>path</em> must have its
reference count incremented before passing it in, or decrementing it.
For this reason, values with a reference count of zero are considered
not to be valid filesystem paths and calling any Tcl_FS API function
with such a value will result in no action being taken.</p>
<h2 id="fs-api-functions">FS API FUNCTIONS</h2>
<p><strong>Tcl_FSCopyFile</strong> attempts to copy the file given by <em>srcPathPtr</em> to
the path name given by <em>destPathPtr</em>. If the two paths given lie in the
same filesystem (according to <strong>Tcl_FSGetFileSystemForPath</strong>) then that
filesystem\'s function is called (if it is non-NULL). Otherwise the
function returns -1 and sets the <strong>errno</strong> global C variable to the
POSIX error code (which signifies a</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_FSCopyDirectory</strong> attempts to copy the directory given by
<em>srcPathPtr</em> to the path name given by <em>destPathPtr</em>. If the two paths
given lie in the same filesystem (according to
<strong>Tcl_FSGetFileSystemForPath</strong>) then that filesystem\'s function is
called (if it is non-NULL). Otherwise the function returns -1 and sets
the <strong>errno</strong> global C variable to the POSIX error code (which signifies
a</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_FSCreateDirectory</strong> attempts to create the directory given by
<em>pathPtr</em> by calling the owning filesystem\'s function.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_FSDeleteFile</strong> attempts to delete the file given by <em>pathPtr</em> by
calling the owning filesystem\'s function.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_FSRemoveDirectory</strong> attempts to remove the directory given by
<em>pathPtr</em> by calling the owning filesystem\'s function.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_FSRenameFile</strong> attempts to rename the file or directory given by
<em>srcPathPtr</em> to the path name given by <em>destPathPtr</em>. If the two paths
given lie in the same filesystem (according to
<strong>Tcl_FSGetFileSystemForPath</strong>) then that filesystem\'s function is
called (if it is non-NULL). Otherwise the function returns -1 and sets
the <strong>errno</strong> global C variable to the POSIX error code (which signifies
a</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_FSListVolumes</strong> calls each filesystem which has a non-NULL
function and asks them to return their list of root volumes. It
accumulates the return values in a list which is returned to the caller
(with a reference count of 0).</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_FSEvalFileEx</strong> reads the file given by <em>pathPtr</em> using the
encoding identified by <em>encodingName</em> and evaluates its contents as a
Tcl script. It returns the same information as <strong>Tcl_EvalObjEx</strong>. If
<em>encodingName</em> is NULL, the system encoding is used for reading the file
contents. If the file could not be read then a Tcl error is returned to
describe why the file could not be read. The eofchar for files is (\^Z)
for all platforms. If you require a in code for string comparison, you
can use or which will be safely substituted by the Tcl interpreter into
<strong>Tcl_FSEvalFile</strong> is a simpler version of <strong>Tcl_FSEvalFileEx</strong> that
always uses the system encoding when reading the file.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_FSLoadFile</strong> dynamically loads a binary code file into memory and
returns the addresses of two procedures within that file, if they are
defined. The appropriate function for the filesystem to which <em>pathPtr</em>
belongs will be called. If that filesystem does not implement this
function (most virtual filesystems will not, because of OS limitations
in dynamically loading binary code), Tcl will attempt to copy the file
to a temporary directory and load that temporary file.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_FSUnloadFile</strong> reverses the operation, asking for the library
indicated by the <em>loadHandle</em> to be removed from the process. Note that,
unlike with the <strong>unload</strong> command, this does not give the library any
opportunity to clean up.</p>
<p>Both the above functions return a standard Tcl completion code. If an
error occurs, an error message is left in the <em>interp</em>\'s result.</p>
<p>The token provided via the variable indicated by <em>loadHandlePtr</em> may be
used with <strong>Tcl_FindSymbol</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_FSMatchInDirectory</strong> is used by the globbing code to search a
directory for all files which match a given pattern. The appropriate
function for the filesystem to which <em>pathPtr</em> belongs will be called.</p>
<p>The return value is a standard Tcl result indicating whether an error
occurred in globbing. Error messages are placed in interp (unless interp
is NULL, which is allowed), but good results are placed in the resultPtr
given.</p>
<p>Note that the <strong>glob</strong> code implements recursive patterns internally, so
this function will only ever be passed simple patterns, which can be
matched using the logic of <strong>string match</strong>. To handle recursion, Tcl
will call this function frequently asking only for directories to be
returned. A special case of being called with a NULL pattern indicates
that the path needs to be checked only for the correct type.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_FSLink</strong> replaces the library version of <strong>readlink</strong>, and extends
it to support the creation of links. The appropriate function for the
filesystem to which <em>linkNamePtr</em> belongs will be called.</p>
<p>If the <em>toPtr</em> is NULL, a action is performed. The result is a Tcl_Obj
specifying the contents of the symbolic link given by <em>linkNamePtr</em>, or
NULL if the link could not be read. The result is owned by the caller,
which should call <strong>Tcl_DecrRefCount</strong> when the result is no longer
needed. If the <em>toPtr</em> is not NULL, Tcl should create a link of one of
the types passed in in the <em>linkAction</em> flag. This flag is an ORed
combination of <strong>TCL_CREATE_SYMBOLIC_LINK</strong> and
<strong>TCL_CREATE_HARD_LINK</strong>. Where a choice exists (i.e. more than one flag
is passed in), the Tcl convention is to prefer symbolic links. When a
link is successfully created, the return value should be <em>toPtr</em> (which
is therefore already owned by the caller). If unsuccessful, NULL is
returned.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_FSLstat</strong> fills the <em>Tcl_StatBuf</em> structure <em>statPtr</em> with
information about the specified file. You do not need any access rights
to the file to get this information but you need search rights to all
directories named in the path leading to the file. The <em>Tcl_StatBuf</em>
structure includes info regarding device, inode (always 0 on Windows),
privilege mode, nlink (always 1 on Windows), user id (always 0 on
Windows), group id (always 0 on Windows), rdev (same as device on
Windows), size, last access time, last modification time, and last
metadata change time. See <strong>PORTABLE STAT RESULT API</strong> for a description
of how to write portable code to allocate and access the <em>Tcl_StatBuf</em>
structure.</p>
<p>If <em>path</em> exists, <strong>Tcl_FSLstat</strong> returns 0 and the stat structure is
filled with data. Otherwise, -1 is returned, and no stat info is given.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_FSUtime</strong> replaces the library version of utime.</p>
<p>This returns 0 on success and -1 on error (as per the <strong>utime</strong>
documentation). If successful, the function will update the and values
of the file given.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_FSFileAttrsGet</strong> implements read access for the hookable <strong>file</strong>
attributes subcommand. The appropriate function for the filesystem to
which <em>pathPtr</em> belongs will be called.</p>
<p>If the result is <strong>TCL_OK</strong>, then a value was placed in <em>objPtrRef</em>,
which will only be temporarily valid (unless <strong>Tcl_IncrRefCount</strong> is
called).</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_FSFileAttrsSet</strong> implements write access for the hookable <strong>file</strong>
attributes subcommand. The appropriate function for the filesystem to
which <em>pathPtr</em> belongs will be called.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_FSFileAttrStrings</strong> implements part of the hookable <strong>file</strong>
attributes subcommand. The appropriate function for the filesystem to
which <em>pathPtr</em> belongs will be called.</p>
<p>The called procedure may either return an array of strings, or may
instead return NULL and place a Tcl list into the given <em>objPtrRef</em>. Tcl
will take that list and first increment its reference count before using
it. On completion of that use, Tcl will decrement its reference count.
Hence if the list should be disposed of by Tcl when done, it should have
a reference count of zero, and if the list should not be disposed of,
the filesystem should ensure it retains a reference count to the value.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_FSAccess</strong> checks whether the process would be allowed to read,
write or test for existence of the file (or other filesystem object)
whose name is <em>pathname</em>. If <em>pathname</em> is a symbolic link on Unix, then
permissions of the file referred by this symbolic link are tested.</p>
<p>On success (all requested permissions granted), zero is returned. On
error (at least one bit in mode asked for a permission that is denied,
or some other error occurred), -1 is returned.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_FSStat</strong> fills the <em>Tcl_StatBuf</em> structure <em>statPtr</em> with
information about the specified file. You do not need any access rights
to the file to get this information but you need search rights to all
directories named in the path leading to the file. The <em>Tcl_StatBuf</em>
structure includes info regarding device, inode (always 0 on Windows),
privilege mode, nlink (always 1 on Windows), user id (always 0 on
Windows), group id (always 0 on Windows), rdev (same as device on
Windows), size, last access time, last modification time, and last
metadata change time. See <strong>PORTABLE STAT RESULT API</strong> for a description
of how to write portable code to allocate and access the <em>Tcl_StatBuf</em>
structure.</p>
<p>If <em>path</em> exists, <strong>Tcl_FSStat</strong> returns 0 and the stat structure is
filled with data. Otherwise, -1 is returned, and no stat info is given.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_FSOpenFileChannel</strong> opens a file specified by <em>pathPtr</em> and
returns a channel handle that can be used to perform input and output on
the file. This API is modeled after the <strong>fopen</strong> procedure of the Unix
standard I/O library. The syntax and meaning of all arguments is similar
to those given in the Tcl <strong>open</strong> command when opening a file. If an
error occurs while opening the channel, <strong>Tcl_FSOpenFileChannel</strong>
returns NULL and records a POSIX error code that can be retrieved with
<strong>Tcl_GetErrno</strong>. In addition, if <em>interp</em> is non-NULL,
<strong>Tcl_FSOpenFileChannel</strong> leaves an error message in <em>interp</em>\'s result
after any error.</p>
<p>The newly created channel is not registered in the supplied interpreter;
to register it, use <strong>Tcl_RegisterChannel</strong>. If one of the standard
channels, <strong>stdin</strong>, <strong>stdout</strong> or <strong>stderr</strong> was previously closed, the
act of creating the new channel also assigns it as a replacement for the
standard channel.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_FSGetCwd</strong> replaces the library version of <strong>getcwd</strong>.</p>
<p>It returns the Tcl library\'s current working directory. This may be
different to the native platform\'s working directory, which happens
when the current working directory is not in the native filesystem.</p>
<p>The result is a pointer to a Tcl_Obj specifying the current directory,
or NULL if the current directory could not be determined. If NULL is
returned, an error message is left in the <em>interp</em>\'s result.</p>
<p>The result already has its reference count incremented for the caller.
When it is no longer needed, that reference count should be decremented.
This is needed for thread-safety purposes, to allow multiple threads to
access this and related functions, while ensuring the results are always
valid.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_FSChdir</strong> replaces the library version of <strong>chdir</strong>. The path is
normalized and then passed to the filesystem which claims it. If that
filesystem does not implement this function, Tcl will fallback to a
combination of <strong>stat</strong> and <strong>access</strong> to check whether the directory
exists and has appropriate permissions.</p>
<p>For results, see <strong>chdir</strong> documentation. If successful, we keep a
record of the successful path in <em>cwdPathPtr</em> for subsequent calls to
<strong>Tcl_FSGetCwd</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_FSPathSeparator</strong> returns the separator character to be used for
most specific element of the path specified by <em>pathPtr</em> (i.e. the last
part of the path).</p>
<p>The separator is returned as a Tcl_Obj containing a string of length 1.
If the path is invalid, NULL is returned.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_FSJoinPath</strong> takes the given Tcl_Obj, which must be a valid list
(which is allowed to have a reference count of zero), and returns the
path value given by considering the first <em>elements</em> elements as valid
path segments (each path segment may be a complete path, a partial path
or just a single possible directory or file name). If any path segment
is actually an absolute path, then all prior path segments are
discarded. If <em>elements</em> is less than 0, we use the entire list.</p>
<p>It is possible that the returned value is actually an element of the
given list, so the caller should be careful to increment the reference
count of the result before freeing the list.</p>
<p>The returned value, typically with a reference count of zero (but it
could be shared under some conditions), contains the joined path. The
caller must add a reference count to the value before using it. In
particular, the returned value could be an element of the given list, so
freeing the list might free the value prematurely if no reference count
has been taken. If the number of elements is zero, then the returned
value will be an empty-string Tcl_Obj.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_FSSplitPath</strong> takes the given Tcl_Obj, which should be a valid
path, and returns a Tcl list value containing each segment of that path
as an element. It returns a list value with a reference count of zero.
If the passed in <em>lenPtr</em> is non-NULL, the variable it points to will be
updated to contain the number of elements in the returned list.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_FSEqualPaths</strong> tests whether the two paths given represent the
same filesystem object. It returns 1 if the paths are equal, and 0 if
they are different. If either path is NULL, 0 is always returned.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_FSGetNormalizedPath</strong> this important function attempts to extract
from the given Tcl_Obj a unique normalized path representation, whose
string value can be used as a unique identifier for the file.</p>
<p>It returns the normalized path value, owned by Tcl, or NULL if the path
was invalid or could otherwise not be successfully converted. Extraction
of absolute, normalized paths is very efficient (because the filesystem
operates on these representations internally), although the result when
the filesystem contains numerous symbolic links may not be the most
user-friendly version of a path. The return value is owned by Tcl and
has a lifetime equivalent to that of the <em>pathPtr</em> passed in (unless
that is a relative path, in which case the normalized path value may be
freed any time the cwd changes) - the caller can of course increment the
reference count if it wishes to maintain a copy for longer.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_FSJoinToPath</strong> takes the given value, which should usually be a
valid path or NULL, and joins onto it the array of paths segments given.</p>
<p>Returns a value, typically with reference count of zero (but it could be
shared under some conditions), containing the joined path. The caller
must add a reference count to the value before using it. If any of the
values passed into this function (<em>pathPtr</em> or <em>path</em> elements) have a
reference count of zero, they will be freed when this function returns.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_FSConvertToPathType</strong> tries to convert the given Tcl_Obj to a
valid Tcl path type, taking account of the fact that the cwd may have
changed even if this value is already supposedly of the correct type.
The filename may begin with (to indicate current user\'s home directory)
or (to indicate any user\'s home directory).</p>
<p>If the conversion succeeds (i.e. the value is a valid path in one of the
current filesystems), then <strong>TCL_OK</strong> is returned. Otherwise
<strong>TCL_ERROR</strong> is returned, and an error message may be left in the
interpreter.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_FSGetInternalRep</strong> extracts the internal representation of a given
path value, in the given filesystem. If the path value belongs to a
different filesystem, we return NULL. If the internal representation is
currently NULL, we attempt to generate it, by calling the filesystem\'s
<strong>Tcl_FSCreateInternalRepProc</strong>.</p>
<p>Returns NULL or a valid internal path representation. This internal
representation is cached, so that repeated calls to this function will
not require additional conversions.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_FSGetTranslatedPath</strong> attempts to extract the translated path from
the given Tcl_Obj.</p>
<p>If the translation succeeds (i.e. the value is a valid path), then it is
returned. Otherwise NULL will be returned, and an error message may be
left in the interpreter. A path is one which contains no or sequences
(these have been expanded to their current representation in the
filesystem). The value returned is owned by the caller, which must store
it or call <strong>Tcl_DecrRefCount</strong> to ensure memory is freed. This function
is of little practical use, and <strong>Tcl_FSGetNormalizedPath</strong> or
<strong>Tcl_FSGetNativePath</strong> are usually better functions to use for most
purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_FSGetTranslatedStringPath</strong> does the same as
<strong>Tcl_FSGetTranslatedPath</strong>, but returns a character string or NULL. The
string returned is dynamically allocated and owned by the caller, which
must store it or call <strong>ckfree</strong> to ensure it is freed. Again,
<strong>Tcl_FSGetNormalizedPath</strong> or <strong>Tcl_FSGetNativePath</strong> are usually
better functions to use for most purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_FSNewNativePath</strong> performs something like the reverse of the usual
obj->path->nativerep conversions. If some code retrieves a path in
native form (from, e.g. <strong>readlink</strong> or a native dialog), and that path
is to be used at the Tcl level, then calling this function is an
efficient way of creating the appropriate path value type.</p>
<p>The resulting value is a pure value, which will only receive a UTF-8
string representation if that is required by some Tcl code.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_FSGetNativePath</strong> is for use by the Win/Unix native filesystems,
so that they can easily retrieve the native (char* or TCHAR*)
representation of a path. This function is a convenience wrapper around
<strong>Tcl_FSGetInternalRep</strong>. It may be desirable in the future to have
non-string-based native representations (for example, on MacOSX, a
representation using a fileSpec of FSRef structure would probably be
more efficient). On Windows a full Unicode representation would allow
for paths of unlimited length. Currently the representation is simply a
character string which may contain either the relative path or a
complete, absolute normalized path in the native encoding (complex
conditions dictate which of these will be provided, so neither can be
relied upon, unless the path is known to be absolute). If you need a
native path which must be absolute, then you should ask for the native
version of a normalized path. If for some reason a non-absolute,
non-normalized version of the path is needed, that must be constructed
separately (e.g. using <strong>Tcl_FSGetTranslatedPath</strong>).</p>
<p>The native representation is cached so that repeated calls to this
function will not require additional conversions. The return value is
owned by Tcl and has a lifetime equivalent to that of the <em>pathPtr</em>
passed in (unless that is a relative path, in which case the native
representation may be freed any time the cwd changes).</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_FSFileSystemInfo</strong> returns a list of two elements. The first
element is the name of the filesystem (e.g. or perhaps), and the second
is the particular type of the given path within that filesystem (which
is filesystem dependent). The second element may be empty if the
filesystem does not provide a further categorization of files.</p>
<p>A valid list value is returned, unless the path value is not recognized,
when NULL will be returned.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_FSGetFileSystemForPath</strong> returns a pointer to the
<strong>Tcl_Filesystem</strong> which accepts this path as valid.</p>
<p>If no filesystem will accept the path, NULL is returned.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_FSGetPathType</strong> determines whether the given path is relative to
the current directory, relative to the current volume, or absolute.</p>
<p>It returns one of <strong>TCL_PATH_ABSOLUTE</strong>, <strong>TCL_PATH_RELATIVE</strong>, or
<strong>TCL_PATH_VOLUME_RELATIVE</strong></p>
<h2 id="portable-stat-result-api">PORTABLE STAT RESULT API</h2>
<p><strong>Tcl_AllocStatBuf</strong> allocates a <em>Tcl_StatBuf</em> on the system heap (which
may be deallocated by being passed to <strong>ckfree</strong>). This allows
extensions to invoke <strong>Tcl_FSStat</strong> and <strong>Tcl_FSLstat</strong> without being
dependent on the size of the buffer. That in turn depends on the flags
used to build Tcl.</p>
<p>The portable fields of a <em>Tcl_StatBuf</em> may be read using the following

<h1 id="the-virtual-filesystem-api">THE VIRTUAL FILESYSTEM API</h1>
<p>A filesystem provides a <strong>Tcl_Filesystem</strong> structure that contains
pointers to functions that implement the various operations on a
filesystem; these operations are invoked as needed by the generic layer,
which generally occurs through the functions listed above.</p>
<p>The <strong>Tcl_Filesystem</strong> structures are manipulated using the following
methods.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_FSRegister</strong> takes a pointer to a filesystem structure and an
optional piece of data to associated with that filesystem. On calling
this function, Tcl will attach the filesystem to the list of known
filesystems, and it will become fully functional immediately. Tcl does
not check if the same filesystem is registered multiple times (and in
general that is not a good thing to do). <strong>TCL_OK</strong> will be returned.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_FSUnregister</strong> removes the given filesystem structure from the
list of known filesystems, if it is known, and returns <strong>TCL_OK</strong>. If
the filesystem is not currently registered, <strong>TCL_ERROR</strong> is returned.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_FSData</strong> will return the ClientData associated with the given
filesystem, if that filesystem is registered. Otherwise it will return
NULL.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_FSMountsChanged</strong> is used to inform the Tcl\'s core that the set
of mount points for the given (already registered) filesystem have
changed, and that cached file representations may therefore no longer be
correct.</p>
<h2 id="the-tcl_filesystem-structure">THE TCL_FILESYSTEM STRUCTURE</h2>
<p>The <strong>Tcl_Filesystem</strong> structure contains the following fields:</p>

<p>Except for the first three fields in this structure which contain simple
data elements, all entries contain addresses of functions called by the
generic filesystem layer to perform the complete range of filesystem
related actions.</p>
<p>The many functions in this structure are broken down into three
categories: infrastructure functions (almost all of which must be
implemented), operational functions (which must be implemented if a
complete filesystem is provided), and efficiency functions (which need
only be implemented if they can be done so efficiently, or if they have
side-effects which are required by the filesystem; Tcl has less
efficient emulations it can fall back on). It is important to note that,
in the current version of Tcl, most of these fallbacks are only used to
handle commands initiated in Tcl, not in C. What this means is, that if
a <strong>file rename</strong> command is issued in Tcl, and the relevant
filesystem(s) do not implement their <em>Tcl_FSRenameFileProc</em>, Tcl\'s core
will instead fallback on a combination of other filesystem functions (it
will use <em>Tcl_FSCopyFileProc</em> followed by <em>Tcl_FSDeleteFileProc</em>, and if
<em>Tcl_FSCopyFileProc</em> is not implemented there is a further fallback).
However, if a <em>Tcl_FSRenameFileProc</em> command is issued at the C level,
no such fallbacks occur. This is true except for the last four entries
in the filesystem table (<strong>lstat</strong>, <strong>load</strong>, <strong>getcwd</strong> and <strong>chdir</strong>)
for which fallbacks do in fact occur at the C level.</p>
<p>Any functions which take path names in Tcl_Obj form take those names in
UTF-8 form. The filesystem infrastructure API is designed to support
efficient, cached conversion of these UTF-8 paths to other native
representations.</p>

<h1 id="filesystem-infrastructure">FILESYSTEM INFRASTRUCTURE</h1>
<p>These fields contain basic information about the filesystem structure
and addresses of functions which are used to associate a particular
filesystem with a file path, and deal with the internal handling of path
representations, for example copying and freeing such representations.</p>
<h2 id="typename">TYPENAME</h2>
<p>The <em>typeName</em> field contains a null-terminated string that identifies
the type of the filesystem implemented, e.g. or</p>
<h2 id="structure-length">STRUCTURE LENGTH</h2>
<p>The <em>structureLength</em> field is generally implemented as
<em>sizeof(Tcl_Filesystem)</em>, and is there to allow easier binary backwards
compatibility if the size of the structure changes in a future Tcl
release.</p>
<h2 id="version">VERSION</h2>
<p>The <em>version</em> field should be set to <strong>TCL_FILESYSTEM_VERSION_1</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="pathinfilesystemproc">PATHINFILESYSTEMPROC</h2>
<p>The <em>pathInFilesystemProc</em> field contains the address of a function
which is called to determine whether a given path value belongs to this
filesystem or not. Tcl will only call the rest of the filesystem
functions with a path for which this function has returned <strong>TCL_OK</strong>.
If the path does not belong, -1 should be returned (the behavior of Tcl
for any other return value is not defined). If <strong>TCL_OK</strong> is returned,
then the optional <em>clientDataPtr</em> output parameter can be used to return
an internal (filesystem specific) representation of the path, which will
be cached inside the path value, and may be retrieved efficiently by the
other filesystem functions. Tcl will simultaneously cache the fact that
this path belongs to this filesystem. Such caches are invalidated when
filesystem structures are added or removed from Tcl\'s internal list of
known filesystems.</p>

<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>typedef Tcl_Obj *Tcl_FSInternalToNormalizedProc(
        ClientData clientData);
</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="createinternalrepproc">CREATEINTERNALREPPROC</h2>
<p>Function to take a path value, and calculate an internal representation
for it, and store that native representation in the value. May be NULL
if paths have no internal representation, or if the
<em>Tcl_FSPathInFilesystemProc</em> for this filesystem always immediately
creates an internal representation for paths it accepts.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>typedef ClientData Tcl_FSCreateInternalRepProc(
        Tcl_Obj *pathPtr);
</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="normalizepathproc">NORMALIZEPATHPROC</h2>
<p>Function to normalize a path. Should be implemented for all filesystems
which can have multiple string representations for the same path value.
In Tcl, every must have a single unique string representation. Depending
on the filesystem, there may be more than one unnormalized string
representation which refers to that path (e.g. a relative path, a path
with different character case if the filesystem is case insensitive, a
path contain a reference to a home directory such as a path containing
symbolic links, etc). If the very last component in the path is a
symbolic link, it should not be converted into the value it points to
(but its case or other aspects should be made unique). All other path
components should be converted from symbolic links. This one exception
is required to agree with Tcl\'s semantics with <strong>file</strong> delete, <strong>file
rename</strong>, <strong>file copy</strong> operating on symbolic links. This function may
be called with <em>nextCheckpoint</em> either at the beginning of the path
(i.e. zero), at the end of the path, or at any intermediate file
separator in the path. It will never point to any other arbitrary
position in the path. In the last of the three valid cases, the
implementation can assume that the path up to and including the file
separator is known and normalized.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>typedef int Tcl_FSNormalizePathProc(
        Tcl_Interp *interp,
        Tcl_Obj *pathPtr,
        int nextCheckpoint);
</code></pre></div>
<h1 id="filesystem-operations">FILESYSTEM OPERATIONS</h1>
<p>The fields in this section of the structure contain addresses of
functions which are called to carry out the basic filesystem operations.
A filesystem which expects to be used with the complete standard Tcl
command set must implement all of these. If some of them are not
implemented, then certain Tcl commands may fail when operating on paths
within that filesystem. However, in some instances this may be desirable
(for example, a read-only filesystem should not implement the last four
functions, and a filesystem which does not support symbolic links need
not implement the <strong>readlink</strong> function, etc. The Tcl core expects
filesystems to behave in this way).</p>
<h2 id="filesystempathtypeproc">FILESYSTEMPATHTYPEPROC</h2>
<p>Function to determine the type of a path in this filesystem. May be
NULL, in which case no type information will be available to users of
the filesystem. The is used only for informational purposes, and should
be returned as the string representation of the Tcl_Obj which is
returned. A typical return value might be or The Tcl_Obj result is owned
by the filesystem and so Tcl will increment the reference count of that
value if it wishes to retain a reference to it.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>typedef Tcl_Obj *Tcl_FSFilesystemPathTypeProc(
        Tcl_Obj *pathPtr);
</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="filesystemseparatorproc">FILESYSTEMSEPARATORPROC</h2>
<p>Function to return the separator character(s) for this filesystem. This
need only be implemented if the filesystem wishes to use a different
separator than the standard string Amongst other uses, it is returned by
the <strong>file separator</strong> command. The return value should be a value with
reference count of zero.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>typedef Tcl_Obj *Tcl_FSFilesystemSeparatorProc(
        Tcl_Obj *pathPtr);
</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="statproc">STATPROC</h2>
<p>Function to process a <strong>Tcl_FSStat</strong> call. Must be implemented for any
reasonable filesystem, since many Tcl level commands depend crucially
upon it (e.g. <strong>file atime</strong>, <strong>file isdirectory</strong>, <strong>file size</strong>,
<strong>glob</strong>).</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>typedef int Tcl_FSStatProc(
        Tcl_Obj *pathPtr,
        Tcl_StatBuf *statPtr);
</code></pre></div>
<p>The <strong>Tcl_FSStatProc</strong> fills the stat structure <em>statPtr</em> with
information about the specified file. You do not need any access rights
to the file to get this information but you need search rights to all
directories named in the path leading to the file. The stat structure
includes info regarding device, inode (always 0 on Windows), privilege
mode, nlink (always 1 on Windows), user id (always 0 on Windows), group
id (always 0 on Windows), rdev (same as device on Windows), size, last
access time, last modification time, and last metadata change time.</p>
<p>If the file represented by <em>pathPtr</em> exists, the <strong>Tcl_FSStatProc</strong>
returns 0 and the stat structure is filled with data. Otherwise, -1 is
returned, and no stat info is given.</p>
<h2 id="accessproc">ACCESSPROC</h2>
<p>Function to process a <strong>Tcl_FSAccess</strong> call. Must be implemented for any
reasonable filesystem, since many Tcl level commands depend crucially
upon it (e.g. <strong>file exists</strong>, <strong>file readable</strong>).</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>typedef int Tcl_FSAccessProc(
        Tcl_Obj *pathPtr,
        int mode);
</code></pre></div>
<p>The <strong>Tcl_FSAccessProc</strong> checks whether the process would be allowed to
read, write or test for existence of the file (or other filesystem
object) whose name is in <em>pathPtr</em>. If the pathname refers to a symbolic
link, then the permissions of the file referred by this symbolic link
should be tested.</p>
<p>On success (all requested permissions granted), zero is returned. On
error (at least one bit in mode asked for a permission that is denied,
or some other error occurred), -1 is returned.</p>
<h2 id="openfilechannelproc">OPENFILECHANNELPROC</h2>
<p>Function to process a <strong>Tcl_FSOpenFileChannel</strong> call. Must be
implemented for any reasonable filesystem, since any operations which
require open or accessing a file\'s contents will use it (e.g. <strong>open</strong>,
<strong>encoding</strong>, and many Tk commands).</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>typedef Tcl_Channel Tcl_FSOpenFileChannelProc(
        Tcl_Interp *interp,
        Tcl_Obj *pathPtr,
        int mode,
        int permissions);
</code></pre></div>
<p>The <strong>Tcl_FSOpenFileChannelProc</strong> opens a file specified by <em>pathPtr</em>
and returns a channel handle that can be used to perform input and
output on the file. This API is modeled after the <strong>fopen</strong> procedure of
the Unix standard I/O library. The syntax and meaning of all arguments
is similar to those given in the Tcl <strong>open</strong> command when opening a
file, where the <em>mode</em> argument is a combination of the POSIX flags
O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, etc. If an error occurs while opening the channel,
the <strong>Tcl_FSOpenFileChannelProc</strong> returns NULL and records a POSIX error
code that can be retrieved with <strong>Tcl_GetErrno</strong>. In addition, if
<em>interp</em> is non-NULL, the <strong>Tcl_FSOpenFileChannelProc</strong> leaves an error
message in <em>interp</em>\'s result after any error.</p>
<p>The newly created channel must not be registered in the supplied
interpreter by a <strong>Tcl_FSOpenFileChannelProc</strong>; that task is up to the
caller of <strong>Tcl_FSOpenFileChannel</strong> (if necessary). If one of the
standard channels, <strong>stdin</strong>, <strong>stdout</strong> or <strong>stderr</strong> was previously
closed, the act of creating the new channel also assigns it as a
replacement for the standard channel.</p>
<h2 id="matchindirectoryproc">MATCHINDIRECTORYPROC</h2>
<p>Function to process a <strong>Tcl_FSMatchInDirectory</strong> call. If not
implemented, then glob and recursive copy functionality will be lacking
in the filesystem (and this may impact commands like <strong>encoding names</strong>
which use glob functionality internally).</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>typedef int Tcl_FSMatchInDirectoryProc(
        Tcl_Interp *interp,
        Tcl_Obj *resultPtr,
        Tcl_Obj *pathPtr,
        const char *pattern,
        Tcl_GlobTypeData *types);
</code></pre></div>
<p>The function should return all files or directories (or other filesystem
objects) which match the given pattern and accord with the <em>types</em>
specification given. There are two ways in which this function may be
called. If <em>pattern</em> is NULL, then <em>pathPtr</em> is a full path
specification of a single file or directory which should be checked for
existence and correct type. Otherwise, <em>pathPtr</em> is a directory, the
contents of which the function should search for files or directories
which have the correct type. In either case, <em>pathPtr</em> can be assumed to
be both non-NULL and non-empty. It is not currently documented whether
<em>pathPtr</em> will have a file separator at its end of not, so code should
be flexible to both possibilities.</p>
<p>The return value is a standard Tcl result indicating whether an error
occurred in the matching process. Error messages are placed in <em>interp</em>,
unless <em>interp</em> in NULL in which case no error message need be
generated; on a <strong>TCL_OK</strong> result, results should be added to the
<em>resultPtr</em> value given (which can be assumed to be a valid unshared Tcl
list). The matches added to <em>resultPtr</em> should include any path prefix
given in <em>pathPtr</em> (this usually means they will be absolute path
specifications). Note that if no matches are found, that simply leads to
an empty result; errors are only signaled for actual file or filesystem
problems which may occur during the matching process.</p>
<p>The <strong>Tcl_GlobTypeData</strong> structure passed in the <em>types</em> parameter
contains the following fields:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>typedef struct Tcl_GlobTypeData {
    /* Corresponds to bcdpfls as in &#39;find -t&#39; */
    int type;
    /* Corresponds to file permissions */
    int perm;
    /* Acceptable mac type */
    Tcl_Obj *macType;
    /* Acceptable mac creator */
    Tcl_Obj *macCreator;
} Tcl_GlobTypeData;
</code></pre></div>
<p>There are two specific cases which it is important to handle correctly,
both when <em>types</em> is non-NULL. The two cases are when <em>types->types</em> &amp;
TCL_GLOB_TYPE_DIR or <em>types->types &amp; TCL_GLOB_TYPE_MOUNT</em> are true (and
in particular when the other flags are false). In the first of these
cases, the function must list the contained directories. Tcl uses this
to implement recursive globbing, so it is critical that filesystems
implement directory matching correctly. In the second of these cases,
with <strong>TCL_GLOB_TYPE_MOUNT</strong>, the filesystem must list the mount points
which lie within the given <em>pathPtr</em> (and in this case, <em>pathPtr</em> need
not lie within the same filesystem - different to all other cases in
which this function is called). Support for this is critical if Tcl is
to have seamless transitions between from one filesystem to another.</p>
<h2 id="utimeproc">UTIMEPROC</h2>
<p>Function to process a <strong>Tcl_FSUtime</strong> call. Required to allow setting
(not reading) of times with <strong>file mtime</strong>, <strong>file atime</strong> and the
open-r/open-w/fcopy implementation of <strong>file copy</strong>.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>typedef int Tcl_FSUtimeProc(
        Tcl_Obj *pathPtr,
        struct utimbuf *tval);
</code></pre></div>
<p>The access and modification times of the file specified by <em>pathPtr</em>
should be changed to the values given in the <em>tval</em> structure.</p>
<p>The return value should be 0 on success and -1 on an error, as with the
system <strong>utime</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="linkproc">LINKPROC</h2>
<p>Function to process a <strong>Tcl_FSLink</strong> call. Should be implemented only if
the filesystem supports links, and may otherwise be NULL.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>typedef Tcl_Obj *Tcl_FSLinkProc(
        Tcl_Obj *linkNamePtr,
        Tcl_Obj *toPtr,
        int linkAction);
</code></pre></div>
<p>If <em>toPtr</em> is NULL, the function is being asked to read the contents of
a link. The result is a Tcl_Obj specifying the contents of the link
given by <em>linkNamePtr</em>, or NULL if the link could not be read. The
result is owned by the caller (and should therefore have its ref count
incremented before being returned). Any callers should call
<strong>Tcl_DecrRefCount</strong> on this result when it is no longer needed. If
<em>toPtr</em> is not NULL, the function should attempt to create a link. The
result in this case should be <em>toPtr</em> if the link was successful and
NULL otherwise. In this case the result is not owned by the caller (i.e.
no reference count manipulations on either end are needed). See the
documentation for <strong>Tcl_FSLink</strong> for the correct interpretation of the
<em>linkAction</em> flags.</p>
<h2 id="listvolumesproc">LISTVOLUMESPROC</h2>
<p>Function to list any filesystem volumes added by this filesystem. Should
be implemented only if the filesystem adds volumes at the head of the
filesystem, so that they can be returned by <strong>file volumes</strong>.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>typedef Tcl_Obj *Tcl_FSListVolumesProc(void);
</code></pre></div>
<p>The result should be a list of volumes added by this filesystem, or NULL
(or an empty list) if no volumes are provided. The result value is
considered to be owned by the filesystem (not by Tcl\'s core), but
should be given a reference count for Tcl. Tcl will use the contents of
the list and then decrement that reference count. This allows
filesystems to choose whether they actually want to retain a of volumes
or not (if not, they generate the list on the fly and pass it to Tcl
with a reference count of 1 and then forget about the list, if yes, then
they simply increment the reference count of their global list and pass
it to Tcl which will copy the contents and then decrement the count back
to where it was).</p>
<p>Therefore, Tcl considers return values from this proc to be read-only.</p>
<h2 id="fileattrstringsproc">FILEATTRSTRINGSPROC</h2>
<p>Function to list all attribute strings which are valid for this
filesystem. If not implemented the filesystem will not support the
<strong>file attributes</strong> command. This allows arbitrary additional
information to be attached to files in the filesystem. If it is not
implemented, there is no need to implement the <strong>get</strong> and <strong>set</strong>
methods.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>typedef const char *const *Tcl_FSFileAttrStringsProc(
        Tcl_Obj *pathPtr,
        Tcl_Obj **objPtrRef);
</code></pre></div>
<p>The called function may either return an array of strings, or may
instead return NULL and place a Tcl list into the given <em>objPtrRef</em>. Tcl
will take that list and first increment its reference count before using
it. On completion of that use, Tcl will decrement its reference count.
Hence if the list should be disposed of by Tcl when done, it should have
a reference count of zero, and if the list should not be disposed of,
the filesystem should ensure it returns a value with a reference count
of at least one.</p>
<h2 id="fileattrsgetproc">FILEATTRSGETPROC</h2>
<p>Function to process a <strong>Tcl_FSFileAttrsGet</strong> call, used by <strong>file</strong>
attributes.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>typedef int Tcl_FSFileAttrsGetProc(
        Tcl_Interp *interp,
        int index,
        Tcl_Obj *pathPtr,
        Tcl_Obj **objPtrRef);
</code></pre></div>
<p>Returns a standard Tcl return code. The attribute value retrieved, which
corresponds to the <em>index</em>\'th element in the list returned by the
<strong>Tcl_FSFileAttrStringsProc</strong>, is a Tcl_Obj placed in <em>objPtrRef</em> (if
<strong>TCL_OK</strong> was returned) and is likely to have a reference count of
zero. Either way we must either store it somewhere (e.g. the Tcl
result), or Incr/Decr its reference count to ensure it is properly
freed.</p>
<h2 id="fileattrssetproc">FILEATTRSSETPROC</h2>
<p>Function to process a <strong>Tcl_FSFileAttrsSet</strong> call, used by <strong>file</strong>
attributes. If the filesystem is read-only, there is no need to
implement this.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>typedef int Tcl_FSFileAttrsSetProc(
        Tcl_Interp *interp,
        int index,
        Tcl_Obj *pathPtr,
        Tcl_Obj *objPtr);
</code></pre></div>
<p>The attribute value of the <em>index</em>\'th element in the list returned by
the Tcl_FSFileAttrStringsProc should be set to the <em>objPtr</em> given.</p>
<h2 id="createdirectoryproc">CREATEDIRECTORYPROC</h2>
<p>Function to process a <strong>Tcl_FSCreateDirectory</strong> call. Should be
implemented unless the FS is read-only.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>typedef int Tcl_FSCreateDirectoryProc(
        Tcl_Obj *pathPtr);
</code></pre></div>
<p>The return value is a standard Tcl result indicating whether an error
occurred in the process. If successful, a new directory should have been
added to the filesystem in the location specified by <em>pathPtr</em>.</p>
<h2 id="removedirectoryproc">REMOVEDIRECTORYPROC</h2>
<p>Function to process a <strong>Tcl_FSRemoveDirectory</strong> call. Should be
implemented unless the FS is read-only.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>typedef int Tcl_FSRemoveDirectoryProc(
        Tcl_Obj *pathPtr,
        int recursive,
        Tcl_Obj **errorPtr);
</code></pre></div>
<p>The return value is a standard Tcl result indicating whether an error
occurred in the process. If successful, the directory specified by
<em>pathPtr</em> should have been removed from the filesystem. If the
<em>recursive</em> flag is given, then a non-empty directory should be deleted
without error. If this flag is not given, then and the directory is
non-empty a POSIX error should be signaled. If an error does occur, the
name of the file or directory which caused the error should be placed in
<em>errorPtr</em>.</p>
<h2 id="deletefileproc">DELETEFILEPROC</h2>
<p>Function to process a <strong>Tcl_FSDeleteFile</strong> call. Should be implemented
unless the FS is read-only.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>typedef int Tcl_FSDeleteFileProc(
        Tcl_Obj *pathPtr);
</code></pre></div>
<p>The return value is a standard Tcl result indicating whether an error
occurred in the process. If successful, the file specified by <em>pathPtr</em>
should have been removed from the filesystem. Note that, if the
filesystem supports symbolic links, Tcl will always call this function
and not Tcl_FSRemoveDirectoryProc when needed to delete them (even if
they are symbolic links to directories).</p>
<h1 id="filesystem-efficiency">FILESYSTEM EFFICIENCY</h1>
<p>These functions need not be implemented for a particular filesystem
because the core has a fallback implementation available. See each
individual description for the consequences of leaving the field NULL.</p>
<h2 id="lstatproc">LSTATPROC</h2>
<p>Function to process a <strong>Tcl_FSLstat</strong> call. If not implemented, Tcl will
attempt to use the <em>statProc</em> defined above instead. Therefore it need
only be implemented if a filesystem can differentiate between <strong>stat</strong>
and <strong>lstat</strong> calls.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>typedef int Tcl_FSLstatProc(
        Tcl_Obj *pathPtr,
        Tcl_StatBuf *statPtr);
</code></pre></div>
<p>The behavior of this function is very similar to that of the
<strong>Tcl_FSStatProc</strong> defined above, except that if it is applied to a
symbolic link, it returns information about the link, not about the
target file.</p>
<h2 id="copyfileproc">COPYFILEPROC</h2>
<p>Function to process a <strong>Tcl_FSCopyFile</strong> call. If not implemented Tcl
will fall back on <strong>open</strong>-r, <strong>open</strong>-w and <strong>fcopy</strong> as a copying
mechanism. Therefore it need only be implemented if the filesystem can
perform that action more efficiently.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>typedef int Tcl_FSCopyFileProc(
        Tcl_Obj *srcPathPtr,
        Tcl_Obj *destPathPtr);
</code></pre></div>
<p>The return value is a standard Tcl result indicating whether an error
occurred in the copying process. Note that, <em>destPathPtr</em> is the name of
the file which should become the copy of <em>srcPathPtr</em>. It is never the
name of a directory into which <em>srcPathPtr</em> could be copied (i.e. the
function is much simpler than the Tcl level <strong>file</strong> copy subcommand).
Note that, if the filesystem supports symbolic links, Tcl will always
call this function and not <em>copyDirectoryProc</em> when needed to copy them
(even if they are symbolic links to directories). Finally, if the
filesystem determines it cannot support the <strong>file copy</strong> action,
calling <strong>Tcl_SetErrno(EXDEV)</strong> and returning a non-<strong>TCL_OK</strong> result
will tell Tcl to use its standard fallback mechanisms.</p>
<h2 id="renamefileproc">RENAMEFILEPROC</h2>
<p>Function to process a <strong>Tcl_FSRenameFile</strong> call. If not implemented, Tcl
will fall back on a copy and delete mechanism. Therefore it need only be
implemented if the filesystem can perform that action more efficiently.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>typedef int Tcl_FSRenameFileProc(
        Tcl_Obj *srcPathPtr,
        Tcl_Obj *destPathPtr);
</code></pre></div>
<p>The return value is a standard Tcl result indicating whether an error
occurred in the renaming process. If the filesystem determines it cannot
support the <strong>file rename</strong> action, calling <strong>Tcl_SetErrno(EXDEV)</strong> and
returning a non-<strong>TCL_OK</strong> result will tell Tcl to use its standard
fallback mechanisms.</p>
<h2 id="copydirectoryproc">COPYDIRECTORYPROC</h2>
<p>Function to process a <strong>Tcl_FSCopyDirectory</strong> call. If not implemented,
Tcl will fall back on a recursive <strong>file mkdir</strong>, <strong>file copy</strong>
mechanism. Therefore it need only be implemented if the filesystem can
perform that action more efficiently.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>typedef int Tcl_FSCopyDirectoryProc(
        Tcl_Obj *srcPathPtr,
        Tcl_Obj *destPathPtr,
        Tcl_Obj **errorPtr);
</code></pre></div>
<p>The return value is a standard Tcl result indicating whether an error
occurred in the copying process. If an error does occur, the name of the
file or directory which caused the error should be placed in <em>errorPtr</em>.
Note that, <em>destPathPtr</em> is the name of the directory-name which should
become the mirror-image of <em>srcPathPtr</em>. It is not the name of a
directory into which <em>srcPathPtr</em> should be copied (i.e. the function is
much simpler than the Tcl level <strong>file copy</strong> subcommand). Finally, if
the filesystem determines it cannot support the directory copy action,
calling <strong>Tcl_SetErrno(EXDEV)</strong> and returning a non-<strong>TCL_OK</strong> result
will tell Tcl to use its standard fallback mechanisms.</p>
<h2 id="loadfileproc">LOADFILEPROC</h2>
<p>Function to process a <strong>Tcl_FSLoadFile</strong> call. If not implemented, Tcl
will fall back on a copy to native-temp followed by a <strong>Tcl_FSLoadFile</strong>
on that temporary copy. Therefore it need only be implemented if the
filesystem can load code directly, or it can be implemented simply to
return <strong>TCL_ERROR</strong> to disable load functionality in this filesystem
entirely.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>typedef int Tcl_FSLoadFileProc(
        Tcl_Interp *interp,
        Tcl_Obj *pathPtr,
        Tcl_LoadHandle *handlePtr,
        Tcl_FSUnloadFileProc *unloadProcPtr);
</code></pre></div>
<p>Returns a standard Tcl completion code. If an error occurs, an error
message is left in the <em>interp</em>\'s result. The function dynamically
loads a binary code file into memory. On a successful load, the
<em>handlePtr</em> should be filled with a token for the dynamically loaded
file, and the <em>unloadProcPtr</em> should be filled in with the address of a
procedure. The unload procedure will be called with the given
<strong>Tcl_LoadHandle</strong> as its only parameter when Tcl needs to unload the
file. For example, for the native filesystem, the <strong>Tcl_LoadHandle</strong>
returned is currently a token which can be used in the private
<strong>TclpFindSymbol</strong> to access functions in the new code. Each filesystem
is free to define the <strong>Tcl_LoadHandle</strong> as it requires. Finally, if the
filesystem determines it cannot support the file load action, calling
<strong>Tcl_SetErrno(EXDEV)</strong> and returning a non-<strong>TCL_OK</strong> result will tell
Tcl to use its standard fallback mechanisms.</p>
<h2 id="unloadfileproc">UNLOADFILEPROC</h2>
<p>Function to unload a previously successfully loaded file. If load was
implemented, then this should also be implemented, if there is any
cleanup action required.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>typedef void Tcl_FSUnloadFileProc(
        Tcl_LoadHandle loadHandle);
</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="getcwdproc">GETCWDPROC</h2>
<p>Function to process a <strong>Tcl_FSGetCwd</strong> call. Most filesystems need not
implement this. It will usually only be called once, if <strong>getcwd</strong> is
called before <strong>chdir</strong>. May be NULL.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>typedef Tcl_Obj *Tcl_FSGetCwdProc(
        Tcl_Interp *interp);
</code></pre></div>
<p>If the filesystem supports a native notion of a current working
directory (which might perhaps change independent of Tcl), this function
should return that cwd as the result, or NULL if the current directory
could not be determined (e.g. the user does not have appropriate
permissions on the cwd directory). If NULL is returned, an error message
is left in the <em>interp</em>\'s result.</p>
<h2 id="chdirproc">CHDIRPROC</h2>
<p>Function to process a <strong>Tcl_FSChdir</strong> call. If filesystems do not
implement this, it will be emulated by a series of directory access
checks. Otherwise, virtual filesystems which do implement it need only
respond with a positive return result if the <em>pathPtr</em> is a valid,
accessible directory in their filesystem. They need not remember the
result, since that will be automatically remembered for use by
<strong>Tcl_FSGetCwd</strong>. Real filesystems should carry out the correct action
(i.e. call the correct system <strong>chdir</strong> API).</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>typedef int Tcl_FSChdirProc(
        Tcl_Obj *pathPtr);
</code></pre></div>
<p>The <strong>Tcl_FSChdirProc</strong> changes the applications current working
directory to the value specified in <em>pathPtr</em>. The function returns -1
on error or 0 on success.</p>
