<p>The number of elements in the C array. Must be greater than zero.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>Tcl_LinkVar</strong> uses variable traces to keep the Tcl variable named by
<em>varName</em> in sync with the C variable at the address given by <em>addr</em>.
Whenever the Tcl variable is read the value of the C variable will be
returned, and whenever the Tcl variable is written the C variable will
be updated to have the same value. <strong>Tcl_LinkVar</strong> normally returns
<strong>TCL_OK</strong>; if an error occurs while setting up the link (e.g. because
<em>varName</em> is the name of array) then <strong>TCL_ERROR</strong> is returned and the
interpreter\'s result contains an error message.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_LinkArray</strong> is similar, but for arrays of fixed size (given by the
<em>size</em> argument). When asked to allocate the backing C array storage
(via the <em>addr</em> argument being NULL), it writes the address that it
allocated to the Tcl interpreter result.</p>
<p>The <em>type</em> argument specifies the type of the C variable, or the type of
the elements of the C array, and must have one of the following values,
optionally OR\'ed with <strong>TCL_LINK_READ_ONLY</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>TCL_LINK_INT</strong></p>
<p>:   The C variable, or each element of the C array, is of type <strong>int</strong>.
    Any value written into the Tcl variable must have a proper integer
    form acceptable to <strong>Tcl_GetIntFromObj</strong>; attempts to write
    non-integer values into <em>varName</em> will be rejected with Tcl errors.
    Incomplete integer representations (like the empty string, \'+\',
    \'-\' or the hex/octal/decimal/binary prefix) are accepted as if
    they are valid too.</p>
<p><strong>TCL_LINK_UINT</strong></p>
<p>:   The C variable, or each element of the C array, is of type
    <strong>unsigned int</strong>. Any value written into the Tcl variable must have
    a proper unsigned integer form acceptable to
    <strong>Tcl_GetWideIntFromObj</strong> and in the platform\'s defined range for
    the <strong>unsigned int</strong> type; attempts to write non-integer values (or
    values outside the range) into <em>varName</em> will be rejected with Tcl
    errors. Incomplete integer representations (like the empty string,
    \'+\', \'-\' or the hex/octal/decimal/binary prefix) are accepted as
    if they are valid too.</p>
<p><strong>TCL_LINK_CHAR</strong></p>
<p>:   The C variable, or each element of the C array, is of type <strong>char</strong>.
    Any value written into the Tcl variable must have a proper integer
    form acceptable to <strong>Tcl_GetIntFromObj</strong> and be in the range of the
    <strong>char</strong> datatype; attempts to write non-integer or out-of-range
    values into <em>varName</em> will be rejected with Tcl errors. Incomplete
    integer representations (like the empty string, \'+\', \'-\' or the
    hex/octal/decimal/binary prefix) are accepted as if they are valid
    too.</p>
<pre><code>If using an array of these, consider using **TCL_LINK_CHARS**
instead.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>TCL_LINK_CHARS</strong></p>
<p>:   </p>
<p>The C array is of type <strong>char *</strong> and is mapped into Tcl as a string.
Any value written into the Tcl variable must have the same length as the
underlying storage. Only supported with <strong>Tcl_LinkArray</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>TCL_LINK_UCHAR</strong></p>
<p>:   The C variable, or each element of the C array, is of type
    <strong>unsigned char</strong>. Any value written into the Tcl variable must have
    a proper unsigned integer form acceptable to <strong>Tcl_GetIntFromObj</strong>
    and in the platform\'s defined range for the <strong>unsigned char</strong> type;
    attempts to write non-integer values (or values outside the range)
    into <em>varName</em> will be rejected with Tcl errors. Incomplete integer
    representations (like the empty string, \'+\', \'-\' or the
    hex/octal/decimal/binary prefix) are accepted as if they are valid
    too.</p>
<pre><code>If using an array of these, consider using **TCL_LINK_BINARY**
instead.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>TCL_LINK_BINARY</strong></p>
<p>:   </p>
<p>The C array is of type <strong>unsigned char *</strong> and is mapped into Tcl as a
bytearray. Any value written into the Tcl variable must have the same
length as the underlying storage. Only supported with <strong>Tcl_LinkArray</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>TCL_LINK_SHORT</strong></p>
<p>:   The C variable, or each element of the C array, is of type
    <strong>short</strong>. Any value written into the Tcl variable must have a
    proper integer form acceptable to <strong>Tcl_GetIntFromObj</strong> and be in
    the range of the <strong>short</strong> datatype; attempts to write non-integer
    or out-of-range values into <em>varName</em> will be rejected with Tcl
    errors. Incomplete integer representations (like the empty string,
    \'+\', \'-\' or the hex/octal/decimal/binary prefix) are accepted as
    if they are valid too.</p>
<p><strong>TCL_LINK_USHORT</strong></p>
<p>:   The C variable, or each element of the C array, is of type
    <strong>unsigned short</strong>. Any value written into the Tcl variable must
    have a proper unsigned integer form acceptable to
    <strong>Tcl_GetIntFromObj</strong> and in the platform\'s defined range for the
    <strong>unsigned short</strong> type; attempts to write non-integer values (or
    values outside the range) into <em>varName</em> will be rejected with Tcl
    errors. Incomplete integer representations (like the empty string,
    \'+\', \'-\' or the hex/octal/decimal/binary prefix) are accepted as
    if they are valid too.</p>
<p><strong>TCL_LINK_LONG</strong></p>
<p>:   The C variable, or each element of the C array, is of type <strong>long</strong>.
    Any value written into the Tcl variable must have a proper integer
    form acceptable to <strong>Tcl_GetLongFromObj</strong>; attempts to write
    non-integer or out-of-range values into <em>varName</em> will be rejected
    with Tcl errors. Incomplete integer representations (like the empty
    string, \'+\', \'-\' or the hex/octal/decimal/binary prefix) are
    accepted as if they are valid too.</p>
<p><strong>TCL_LINK_ULONG</strong></p>
<p>:   The C variable, or each element of the C array, is of type
    <strong>unsigned long</strong>. Any value written into the Tcl variable must have
    a proper unsigned integer form acceptable to
    <strong>Tcl_GetWideIntFromObj</strong> and in the platform\'s defined range for
    the <strong>unsigned long</strong> type; attempts to write non-integer values (or
    values outside the range) into <em>varName</em> will be rejected with Tcl
    errors. Incomplete integer representations (like the empty string,
    \'+\', \'-\' or the hex/octal/decimal/binary prefix) are accepted as
    if they are valid too.</p>
<p><strong>TCL_LINK_DOUBLE</strong></p>
<p>:   The C variable, or each element of the C array, is of type
    <strong>double</strong>. Any value written into the Tcl variable must have a
    proper real form acceptable to <strong>Tcl_GetDoubleFromObj</strong>; attempts to
    write non-real values into <em>varName</em> will be rejected with Tcl
    errors. Incomplete integer or real representations (like the empty
    string, \'.\', \'+\', \'-\' or the hex/octal/decimal/binary prefix)
    are accepted as if they are valid too.</p>
<p><strong>TCL_LINK_FLOAT</strong></p>
<p>:   The C variable, or each element of the C array, is of type
    <strong>float</strong>. Any value written into the Tcl variable must have a
    proper real form acceptable to <strong>Tcl_GetDoubleFromObj</strong> and must be
    within the range acceptable for a <strong>float</strong>; attempts to write
    non-real values (or values outside the range) into <em>varName</em> will be
    rejected with Tcl errors. Incomplete integer or real representations
    (like the empty string, \'.\', \'+\', \'-\' or the
    hex/octal/decimal/binary prefix) are accepted as if they are valid
    too.</p>
<p><strong>TCL_LINK_WIDE_INT</strong></p>
<p>:   The C variable, or each element of the C array, is of type
    <strong>Tcl_WideInt</strong> (which is an integer type at least 64-bits wide on
    all platforms that can support it.) Any value written into the Tcl
    variable must have a proper integer form acceptable to
    <strong>Tcl_GetWideIntFromObj</strong>; attempts to write non-integer values into
    <em>varName</em> will be rejected with Tcl errors. Incomplete integer
    representations (like the empty string, \'+\', \'-\' or the
    hex/octal/decimal/binary prefix) are accepted as if they are valid
    too.</p>
<p><strong>TCL_LINK_WIDE_UINT</strong></p>
<p>:   The C variable, or each element of the C array, is of type
    <strong>Tcl_WideUInt</strong> (which is an unsigned integer type at least 64-bits
    wide on all platforms that can support it.) Any value written into
    the Tcl variable must have a proper unsigned wideinteger form
    acceptable to <strong>Tcl_GetWideUIntFromObj</strong>; attempts to write
    non-integer values into <em>varName</em> will be rejected with Tcl errors.
    Incomplete integer representations (like the empty string, \'+\',
    \'-\' or the hex/octal/decimal/binary prefix) are accepted as if
    they are valid too.</p>
<p><strong>TCL_LINK_BOOLEAN</strong></p>
<p>:   The C variable, or each element of the C array, is of type <strong>int</strong>.
    If its value is zero then it will read from Tcl as</p>
<p>otherwise it will read from Tcl as</p>
<p>Whenever <em>varName</em> is modified, the C variable will be set to a 0 or 1
value. Any value written into the Tcl variable must have a proper
boolean form acceptable to <strong>Tcl_GetBooleanFromObj</strong>; attempts to write
non-boolean values into <em>varName</em> will be rejected with Tcl errors.</p>
<p><strong>TCL_LINK_STRING</strong></p>
<p>:   The C variable is of type <strong>char *</strong>. If its value is not NULL then
    it must be a pointer to a string allocated with <strong>Tcl_Alloc</strong>.
    Whenever the Tcl variable is modified the current C string will be
    freed and new memory will be allocated to hold a copy of the
    variable\'s new value. If the C variable contains a NULL pointer
    then the Tcl variable will read as</p>
<p>This is only supported by <strong>Tcl_LinkVar</strong>.</p>
<p>If the <strong>TCL_LINK_READ_ONLY</strong> flag is present in <em>type</em> then the
variable will be read-only from Tcl, so that its value can only be
changed by modifying the C variable. Attempts to write the variable from
Tcl will be rejected with errors.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_UnlinkVar</strong> removes the link previously set up for the variable
given by <em>varName</em>. If there does not exist a link for <em>varName</em> then
the procedure has no effect.</p>
<p><strong>Tcl_UpdateLinkedVar</strong> may be invoked after the C variable has changed
to force the Tcl variable to be updated immediately. In many cases this
procedure is not needed, since any attempt to read the Tcl variable will
return the latest value of the C variable. However, if a trace has been
set on the Tcl variable (such as a Tk widget that wishes to display the
value of the variable), the trace will not trigger when the C variable
has changed. <strong>Tcl_UpdateLinkedVar</strong> ensures that any traces on the Tcl
variable are invoked.</p>
<p>Note that, as with any call to a Tcl interpreter,
<strong>Tcl_UpdateLinkedVar</strong> must be called from the same thread that created
the interpreter. The safest mechanism is to ensure that the C variable
is only ever updated from the same thread that created the interpreter
(possibly in response to an event posted with <strong>Tcl_ThreadQueueEvent</strong>),
but when it is necessary to update the variable in a separate thread, it
is advised that <strong>Tcl_AsyncMark</strong> be used to indicate to the thread
hosting the interpreter that it is ready to run <strong>Tcl_UpdateLinkedVar</strong>.</p>
