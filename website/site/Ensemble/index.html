<h1 id="arguments">ARGUMENTS</h1>
<p>The interpreter in which the ensemble is to be created or found. Also
where error result messages are written. The functions whose names start
with <strong>Tcl_GetEnsemble</strong> may have a NULL for the <em>interp</em>, but all other
functions must not.</p>
<p>The name of the ensemble command to be created.</p>
<p>The namespace to which the ensemble command is to be bound, or NULL for
the current namespace.</p>
<p>An OR\'ed set of flag bits describing the basic configuration of the
ensemble. Currently only one bit has meaning, <strong>TCL_ENSEMBLE_PREFIX</strong>,
which is present when the ensemble command should also match unambiguous
prefixes of subcommands.</p>
<p>A value holding the name of the ensemble command to look up.</p>
<p>An OR\'ed set of flag bits controlling the behavior of
<strong>Tcl_FindEnsemble</strong>. Currently only <strong>TCL_LEAVE_ERR_MSG</strong> is supported.</p>
<p>A normal command token that refers to an ensemble command, or which you
wish to use for testing as an ensemble command in <strong>Tcl_IsEnsemble</strong>.</p>
<p>Pointer to a variable into which to write the current ensemble flag
bits; currently only the bit <strong>TCL_ENSEMBLE_PREFIX</strong> is defined.</p>
<p>A dictionary value to use for the subcommand to implementation command
prefix mapping dictionary in the ensemble. May be NULL if the mapping
dictionary is to be removed.</p>
<p>Pointer to a variable into which to write the current ensemble mapping
dictionary.</p>
<p>A list value to use for the list of formal pre-subcommand parameters,
the defined list of subcommands in the dictionary or the unknown
subcommand handler command prefix. May be NULL if the subcommand list or
unknown handler are to be removed.</p>
<p>Pointer to a variable into which to write the current list of formal
pre-subcommand parameters, the defined list of subcommands or the
current unknown handler prefix.</p>
<p>Pointer to a variable into which to write the handle of the namespace to
which the ensemble is bound.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>An ensemble is a command, bound to some namespace, which consists of a
collection of subcommands implemented by other Tcl commands. The first
argument to the ensemble command is always interpreted as a selector
that states what subcommand to execute.</p>
<p>Ensembles are created using <strong>Tcl_CreateEnsemble</strong>, which takes four
arguments: the interpreter to work within, the name of the ensemble to
create, the namespace within the interpreter to bind the ensemble to,
and the default set of ensemble flags. The result of the function is the
command token for the ensemble, which may be used to further configure
the ensemble using the API described below in <strong>ENSEMBLE PROPERTIES</strong>.</p>
<p>Given the name of an ensemble command, the token for that command may be
retrieved using <strong>Tcl_FindEnsemble</strong>. If the given command name (in
<em>cmdNameObj</em>) does not refer to an ensemble command, the result of the
function is NULL and (if the <strong>TCL_LEAVE_ERR_MSG</strong> bit is set in
<em>flags</em>) an error message is left in the interpreter result.</p>
<p>A command token may be checked to see if it refers to an ensemble using
<strong>Tcl_IsEnsemble</strong>. This returns 1 if the token refers to an ensemble,
or 0 otherwise.</p>
<h2 id="ensemble-properties">ENSEMBLE PROPERTIES</h2>
<p>Every ensemble has four read-write properties and a read-only property.
The properties are:</p>
<p><strong>flags</strong> (read-write)</p>
<p>:   The set of flags for the ensemble, expressed as a bit-field.
    Currently, the only public flag is <strong>TCL_ENSEMBLE_PREFIX</strong> which is
    set when unambiguous prefixes of subcommands are permitted to be
    resolved to implementations as well as exact matches. The flags may
    be read and written using <strong>Tcl_GetEnsembleFlags</strong> and
    <strong>Tcl_SetEnsembleFlags</strong> respectively. The result of both of those
    functions is a Tcl result code (<strong>TCL_OK</strong>, or <strong>TCL_ERROR</strong> if the
    token does not refer to an ensemble).</p>
<p><strong>mapping dictionary</strong> (read-write)</p>
<p>:   A dictionary containing a mapping from subcommand names to lists of
    words to use as a command prefix (replacing the first two words of
    the command which are the ensemble command itself and the subcommand
    name), or NULL if every subcommand is to be mapped to the command
    with the same unqualified name in the ensemble\'s bound namespace.
    Defaults to NULL. May be read and written using
    <strong>Tcl_GetEnsembleMappingDict</strong> and <strong>Tcl_SetEnsembleMappingDict</strong>
    respectively. The result of both of those functions is a Tcl result
    code (<strong>TCL_OK</strong>, or <strong>TCL_ERROR</strong> if the token does not refer to an
    ensemble) and the dictionary obtained from
    <strong>Tcl_GetEnsembleMappingDict</strong> should always be treated as immutable
    even if it is unshared. All command names in prefixes set via
    <strong>Tcl_SetEnsembleMappingDict</strong> must be fully qualified.</p>
<p><strong>formal pre-subcommand parameter list</strong> (read-write)</p>
<p>:   A list of formal parameter names (the names only being used when
    generating error messages) that come at invocation of the ensemble
    between the name of the ensemble and the subcommand argument. NULL
    (the default) is equivalent to the empty list. May be read and
    written using <strong>Tcl_GetEnsembleParameterList</strong> and
    <strong>Tcl_SetEnsembleParameterList</strong> respectively. The result of both of
    those functions is a Tcl result code (<strong>TCL_OK</strong>, or <strong>TCL_ERROR</strong>
    if the token does not refer to an ensemble) and the dictionary
    obtained from <strong>Tcl_GetEnsembleParameterList</strong> should always be
    treated as immutable even if it is unshared.</p>
<p><strong>subcommand list</strong> (read-write)</p>
<p>:   A list of all the subcommand names for the ensemble, or NULL if this
    is to be derived from either the keys of the mapping dictionary (see
    above) or (if that is also NULL) from the set of commands exported
    by the bound namespace. May be read and written using
    <strong>Tcl_GetEnsembleSubcommandList</strong> and
    <strong>Tcl_SetEnsembleSubcommandList</strong> respectively. The result of both
    of those functions is a Tcl result code (<strong>TCL_OK</strong>, or
    <strong>TCL_ERROR</strong> if the token does not refer to an ensemble) and the
    list obtained from <strong>Tcl_GetEnsembleSubcommandList</strong> should always
    be treated as immutable even if it is unshared.</p>
<p><strong>unknown subcommand handler command prefix</strong> (read-write)</p>
<p>:   A list of words to prepend on the front of any subcommand when the
    subcommand is unknown to the ensemble (according to the current
    prefix handling rule); see the <strong>namespace ensemble</strong> command for
    more details. If NULL, the default behavior - generate a suitable
    error message - will be used when an unknown subcommand is
    encountered. May be read and written using
    <strong>Tcl_GetEnsembleUnknownHandler</strong> and
    <strong>Tcl_SetEnsembleUnknownHandler</strong> respectively. The result of both
    functions is a Tcl result code (<strong>TCL_OK</strong>, or <strong>TCL_ERROR</strong> if the
    token does not refer to an ensemble) and the list obtained from
    <strong>Tcl_GetEnsembleUnknownHandler</strong> should always be treated as
    immutable even if it is unshared.</p>
<p><strong>bound namespace</strong> (read-only)</p>
<p>:   The namespace to which the ensemble is bound; when the namespace is
    deleted, so too will the ensemble, and this namespace is also the
    namespace whose list of exported commands is used if both the
    mapping dictionary and the subcommand list properties are NULL. May
    be read using <strong>Tcl_GetEnsembleNamespace</strong> which returns a Tcl
    result code (<strong>TCL_OK</strong>, or <strong>TCL_ERROR</strong> if the token does not
    refer to an ensemble).</p>
<h1 id="reference-count-management">REFERENCE COUNT MANAGEMENT</h1>
<p><strong>Tcl_FindEnsemble</strong> does not modify the reference count of its
<em>cmdNameObj</em> argument; it only reads. Note however that this function
may set the interpreter result; if that is the only place that is
holding a reference to the object, it will be deleted.</p>
<p>The ensemble property getters (<strong>Tcl_GetEnsembleMappingDict</strong>,
<strong>Tcl_GetEnsembleParameterList</strong>, <strong>Tcl_GetEnsembleSubcommandList</strong>, and
<strong>Tcl_GetEnsembleUnknownHandler</strong>) do not manipulate the reference count
of the values they provide out; if those are non-NULL, they will have a
reference count of at least 1. Note that these functions may set the
interpreter result.</p>
<p>The ensemble property setters (<strong>Tcl_SetEnsembleMappingDict</strong>,
<strong>Tcl_SetEnsembleParameterList</strong>, <strong>Tcl_SetEnsembleSubcommandList</strong>, and
<strong>Tcl_SetEnsembleUnknownHandler</strong>) will increment the reference count of
the new value of the property they are given if they succeed (and
decrement the reference count of the old value of the property, if
relevant). If the property setters return <strong>TCL_ERROR</strong>, the reference
count of the Tcl_Obj argument is left unchanged.</p>
