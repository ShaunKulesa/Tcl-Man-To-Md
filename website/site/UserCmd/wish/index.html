<p><strong>wish</strong> ?<strong>-encoding </strong><em>name</em>? ?<em>fileName arg arg ...</em>?</p>
<h1 id="options">OPTIONS</h1>
<p>-encoding name</p>
<p>:   Specifies the encoding of the text stored in <em>fileName</em>. This option
    is only recognized prior to the <em>fileName</em> argument.</p>
<p>-colormap new</p>
<p>:   Specifies that the window should have a new private colormap instead
    of using the default colormap for the screen.</p>
<p>-display display</p>
<p>:   Display (and screen) on which to display window.</p>
<p>-geometry geometry</p>
<p>:   Initial geometry to use for window. If this option is specified, its
    value is stored in the <strong>geometry</strong> global variable of the
    application\'s Tcl interpreter.</p>
<p>-name name</p>
<p>:   Use <em>name</em> as the title to be displayed in the window, and as the
    name of the interpreter for <strong>send</strong> commands.</p>
<p>-sync</p>
<p>:   Execute all X server commands synchronously, so that errors are
    reported immediately. This will result in much slower execution, but
    it is useful for debugging.</p>
<p>-use id</p>
<p>:   Specifies that the main window for the application is to be embedded
    in the window whose identifier is <em>id</em>, instead of being created as
    an independent toplevel window. <em>Id</em> must be specified in the same
    way as the value for the <strong>-use</strong> option for toplevel widgets (i.e.
    it has a form like that returned by the <strong>winfo id</strong> command).</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Note that on some platforms this will only work correctly if *id*
refers to a Tk **frame** or **toplevel** that has its **-container**
option enabled.
</code></pre></div>
<p>-visual visual</p>
<p>:   Specifies the visual to use for the window. <em>Visual</em> may have any of
    the forms supported by the <strong>Tk_GetVisual</strong> procedure.</p>
<p>- -</p>
<p>:   Pass all remaining arguments through to the script\'s <strong>argv</strong>
    variable without interpreting them. This provides a mechanism for
    passing arguments such as <strong>-name</strong> to a script instead of having
    <strong>wish</strong> interpret them.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>Wish</strong> is a simple program consisting of the Tcl command language, the
Tk toolkit, and a main program that reads commands from standard input
or from a file. It creates a main window and then processes Tcl
commands. If <strong>wish</strong> is invoked with arguments, then the first few
arguments, ?<strong>-encoding </strong><em>name</em>? ?<em>fileName</em>?, specify the name of a
script file, and, optionally, the encoding of the text data stored in
that script file. A value for <em>fileName</em> is recognized if the
appropriate argument does not start with</p>
<p>If there are no arguments, or the arguments do not specify a <em>fileName</em>,
then wish reads Tcl commands interactively from standard input. It will
continue processing commands until all windows have been deleted or
until end-of-file is reached on standard input. If there exists a file
in the home directory of the user, <strong>wish</strong> evaluates the file as a Tcl
script just before reading the first command from standard input.</p>
<p>If arguments to <strong>wish</strong> do specify a <em>fileName</em>, then <em>fileName</em> is
treated as the name of a script file. <strong>Wish</strong> will evaluate the script
in <em>fileName</em> (which presumably creates a user interface), then it will
respond to events until all windows have been deleted. Commands will not
be read from standard input. There is no automatic evaluation of when
the name of a script file is presented on the <strong>wish</strong> command line, but
the script file can always <strong>source</strong> it if desired.</p>
<p>Note that on Windows, the <strong>wish</strong><em>version</em><strong>.exe</strong> program varies from
the <strong>tclsh</strong><em>version</em><strong>.exe</strong> program in an additional important way:
it does not connect to a standard Windows console and is instead a
windowed program. Because of this, it additionally provides access to
its own <strong>console</strong> command.</p>
<h1 id="option-processing">OPTION PROCESSING</h1>
<p><strong>Wish</strong> automatically processes all of the command-line options
described in the <strong>OPTIONS</strong> summary above. Any other command-line
arguments besides these are passed through to the application using the
<strong>argc</strong> and <strong>argv</strong> variables described later.</p>
<h1 id="application-name-and-class">APPLICATION NAME AND CLASS</h1>
<p>The name of the application, which is used for purposes such as <strong>send</strong>
commands, is taken from the <strong>-name</strong> option, if it is specified;
otherwise it is taken from <em>fileName</em>, if it is specified, or from the
command name by which <strong>wish</strong> was invoked. In the last two cases, if
the name contains a character, then only the characters after the last
slash are used as the application name.</p>
<p>The class of the application, which is used for purposes such as
specifying options with a <strong>RESOURCE_MANAGER</strong> property or .Xdefaults
file, is the same as its name except that the first letter is
capitalized.</p>
<h1 id="variables">VARIABLES</h1>
<p><strong>Wish</strong> sets the following Tcl variables:</p>
<p><strong>argc</strong></p>
<p>:   Contains a count of the number of <em>arg</em> arguments (0 if none), not
    including the options described above.</p>
<p><strong>argv</strong></p>
<p>:   Contains a Tcl list whose elements are the <em>arg</em> arguments that
    follow a <strong>- -</strong> option or do not match any of the options described
    in <strong>OPTIONS</strong> above, in order, or an empty string if there are no
    such arguments.</p>
<p><strong>argv0</strong></p>
<p>:   Contains <em>fileName</em> if it was specified. Otherwise, contains the
    name by which <strong>wish</strong> was invoked.</p>
<p><strong>geometry</strong></p>
<p>:   If the <strong>-geometry</strong> option is specified, <strong>wish</strong> copies its value
    into this variable. If the variable still exists after <em>fileName</em>
    has been evaluated, <strong>wish</strong> uses the value of the variable in a
    <strong>wm geometry</strong> command to set the main window\'s geometry.</p>
<p><strong>tcl_interactive</strong></p>
<p>:   Contains 1 if <strong>wish</strong> is reading commands interactively (<em>fileName</em>
    was not specified and standard input is a terminal-like device), 0
    otherwise.</p>
<h1 id="script-files">SCRIPT FILES</h1>
<p>If you create a Tcl script in a file whose first line is</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>#!/usr/local/bin/wish
</code></pre></div>
<p>then you can invoke the script file directly from your shell if you mark
it as executable. This assumes that <strong>wish</strong> has been installed in the
default location in /usr/local/bin; if it is installed somewhere else
then you will have to modify the above line to match. Many UNIX systems
do not allow the <strong>#!</strong> line to exceed about 30 characters in length, so
be sure that the <strong>wish</strong> executable can be accessed with a short file
name.</p>
<p>An even better approach is to start your script files with the following
three lines:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>#!/bin/sh
# the next line restarts using wish \
exec wish &quot;$0&quot; ${1+&quot;$@&quot;}
</code></pre></div>
<p>This approach has three advantages over the approach in the previous
paragraph. First, the location of the <strong>wish</strong> binary does not have to
be hard-wired into the script: it can be anywhere in your shell search
path. Second, it gets around the 30-character file name limit in the
previous approach. Third, this approach will work even if <strong>wish</strong> is
itself a shell script (this is done on some systems in order to handle
multiple architectures or operating systems: the <strong>wish</strong> script selects
one of several binaries to run). The three lines cause both <strong>sh</strong> and
<strong>wish</strong> to process the script, but the <strong>exec</strong> is only executed by
<strong>sh</strong>. <strong>sh</strong> processes the script first; it treats the second line as
a comment and executes the third line. The <strong>exec</strong> statement cause the
shell to stop processing and instead to start up <strong>wish</strong> to reprocess
the entire script. When <strong>wish</strong> starts up, it treats all three lines as
comments, since the backslash at the end of the second line causes the
third line to be treated as part of the comment on the second line.</p>
<p>The end of a script file may be marked either by the physical end of the
medium, or by the character, If this character is present in the file,
the <strong>wish</strong> application will read text up to but not including the
character. An application that requires this character in the file may
encode it as or or may generate it by use of commands such as <strong>format</strong>
or <strong>binary</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="prompts">PROMPTS</h1>
<p>When <strong>wish</strong> is invoked interactively it normally prompts for each
command with You can change the prompt by setting the variables
<strong>tcl_prompt1</strong> and <strong>tcl_prompt2</strong>. If variable <strong>tcl_prompt1</strong> exists
then it must consist of a Tcl script to output a prompt; instead of
outputting a prompt <strong>wish</strong> will evaluate the script in
<strong>tcl_prompt1</strong>. The variable <strong>tcl_prompt2</strong> is used in a similar way
when a newline is typed but the current command is not yet complete; if
<strong>tcl_prompt2</strong> is not set then no prompt is output for incomplete
commands.</p>
