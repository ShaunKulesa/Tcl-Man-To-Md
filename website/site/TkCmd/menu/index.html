<h1 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>menu</strong> command creates a new top-level window (given by the
<em>pathName</em> argument) and makes it into a menu widget. That menu widget
can either be used as a pop-up window or applied to a <strong>toplevel</strong> (with
its <strong>-menu</strong> option) to make it into the menubar for that toplevel.
Additional options, described above, may be specified on the command
line or in the option database to configure aspects of the menu such as
its colors and font. The <strong>menu</strong> command returns its <em>pathName</em>
argument. At the time this command is invoked, there must not exist a
window named <em>pathName</em>, but <em>pathName</em>\'s parent must exist.</p>
<p>A menu is a widget that displays a collection of one-line entries
arranged in one or more columns. There exist several different types of
entries, each with different properties. Entries of different types may
be combined in a single menu. Menu entries are not the same as entry
widgets. In fact, menu entries are not even distinct widgets; the entire
menu is one widget.</p>
<p>Menu entries are displayed with up to three separate fields. The main
field is a label in the form of a text string, a bitmap, or an image,
controlled by the <strong>-label</strong>, <strong>-bitmap</strong>, and <strong>-image</strong> options for
the entry. If the <strong>-accelerator</strong> option is specified for an entry then
a second textual field is displayed to the right of the label. The
accelerator typically describes a keystroke sequence that may be used in
the application to cause the same result as invoking the menu entry.
This is a display option, it does not actually set the corresponding
binding (which can be achieved using the <strong>bind</strong> command). The third
field is an <em>indicator</em>. The indicator is present only for checkbutton
or radiobutton entries. It indicates whether the entry is selected or
not, and is displayed to the left of the entry\'s string.</p>
<p>In normal use, an entry becomes active (displays itself differently)
whenever the mouse pointer is over the entry. If a mouse button is
released over the entry then the entry is <em>invoked</em>. The effect of
invocation is different for each type of entry; these effects are
described below in the sections on individual entries.</p>
<p>Entries may be <em>disabled</em>, which causes their labels and accelerators to
be displayed with dimmer colors. The default menu bindings will not
allow a disabled entry to be activated or invoked. Disabled entries may
be re-enabled, at which point it becomes possible to activate and invoke
them again.</p>
<p>Whenever a menu\'s active entry is changed, a \&lt;\&lt;MenuSelect>> virtual
event is send to the menu. The active item can then be queried from the
menu, and an action can be taken, such as setting context-sensitive help
text for the entry.</p>
<h1 id="types-of-entries">TYPES OF ENTRIES</h1>
<h2 id="command-entries">COMMAND ENTRIES</h2>
<p>The most common kind of menu entry is a command entry, which behaves
much like a button widget. When a command entry is invoked, a Tcl
command is executed. The Tcl command is specified with the <strong>-command</strong>
option.</p>
<h2 id="separator-entries">SEPARATOR ENTRIES</h2>
<p>A separator is an entry that is displayed as a horizontal dividing line.
A separator may not be activated or invoked, and it has no behavior
other than its display appearance.</p>
<h2 id="checkbutton-entries">CHECKBUTTON ENTRIES</h2>
<p>A checkbutton menu entry behaves much like a checkbutton widget. When it
is invoked it toggles back and forth between the selected and deselected
states. When the entry is selected, a particular value is stored in a
particular global variable (as determined by the <strong>-onvalue</strong> and
<strong>-variable</strong> options for the entry); when the entry is deselected
another value (determined by the <strong>-offvalue</strong> option) is stored in the
global variable. An indicator box is displayed to the left of the label
in a checkbutton entry. If the entry is selected then the indicator\'s
center is displayed in the color given by the <strong>-selectcolor</strong> option
for the entry; otherwise the indicator\'s center is displayed in the
background color for the menu. If a <strong>-command</strong> option is specified for
a checkbutton entry, then its value is evaluated as a Tcl command each
time the entry is invoked; this happens after toggling the entry\'s
selected state.</p>
<h2 id="radiobutton-entries">RADIOBUTTON ENTRIES</h2>
<p>A radiobutton menu entry behaves much like a radiobutton widget.
Radiobutton entries are organized in groups of which only one entry may
be selected at a time. Whenever a particular entry becomes selected it
stores a particular value into a particular global variable (as
determined by the <strong>-value</strong> and <strong>-variable</strong> options for the entry).
This action causes any previously-selected entry in the same group to
deselect itself. Once an entry has become selected, any change to the
entry\'s associated variable will cause the entry to deselect itself.
Grouping of radiobutton entries is determined by their associated
variables: if two entries have the same associated variable then they
are in the same group. An indicator diamond is displayed to the left of
the label in each radiobutton entry. If the entry is selected then the
indicator\'s center is displayed in the color given by the
<strong>-selectcolor</strong> option for the entry; otherwise the indicator\'s center
is displayed in the background color for the menu. If a <strong>-command</strong>
option is specified for a radiobutton entry, then its value is evaluated
as a Tcl command each time the entry is invoked; this happens after
selecting the entry.</p>
<h2 id="cascade-entries">CASCADE ENTRIES</h2>
<p>A cascade entry is one with an associated menu (determined by the
<strong>-menu</strong> option). Cascade entries allow the construction of cascading
menus. The <strong>postcascade</strong> widget command can be used to post and unpost
the associated menu just next to of the cascade entry. The associated
menu must be a child of the menu containing the cascade entry (this is
needed in order for menu traversal to work correctly).</p>
<p>A cascade entry posts its associated menu by invoking a Tcl command of
the form</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>menu post x y
</code></pre></div>
<p>where <em>menu</em> is the path name of the associated menu, and <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>
are the root-window coordinates of the upper-right corner of the cascade
entry. On Unix, the lower-level menu is unposted by executing a Tcl
command with the form</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>menu unpost
</code></pre></div>
<p>where <em>menu</em> is the name of the associated menu. On other platforms, the
platform\'s native code takes care of unposting the menu.</p>
<p>If a <strong>-command</strong> option is specified for a cascade entry then it is
evaluated as a Tcl command whenever the entry is invoked. This is not
supported on Windows.</p>
<h2 id="tear-off-entries">TEAR-OFF ENTRIES</h2>
<p>A tear-off entry appears at the top of the menu if enabled with the
<strong>-tearoff</strong> option. It is not like other menu entries in that it cannot
be created with the <strong>add</strong> widget command and cannot be deleted with
the <strong>delete</strong> widget command. When a tear-off entry is created it
appears as a dashed line at the top of the menu. Under the default
bindings, invoking the tear-off entry causes a torn-off copy to be made
of the menu and all of its submenus.</p>
<h1 id="menubars">MENUBARS</h1>
<p>Any menu can be set as a menubar for a toplevel window (see <strong>toplevel</strong>
command for syntax). On the Macintosh, whenever the toplevel is in
front, this menu\'s cascade items will appear in the menubar across the
top of the main monitor. On Windows and Unix, this menu\'s items will be
displayed in a menubar across the top of the window. These menus will
behave according to the interface guidelines of their platforms. For
every menu set as a menubar, a clone menu is made. See the <strong>CLONES</strong>
section for more information.</p>
<p>As noted, menubars may behave differently on different platforms. One
example of this concerns the handling of checkbuttons and radiobuttons
within the menu. While it is permitted to put these menu elements on
menubars, they may not be drawn with indicators on some platforms, due
to system restrictions.</p>
<h2 id="special-menus-in-menubars">SPECIAL MENUS IN MENUBARS</h2>
<p>Certain menus in a menubar will be treated specially. On the Macintosh,
access to the special Application, Window and Help menus is provided. On
Windows, access to the Windows System menu in each window is provided.
On X Windows, a special right-justified help menu may be provided if
Motif menu compatibility is enabled. In all cases, these menus must be
created with the command name of the menubar menu concatenated with the
special name. So for a menubar named .menubar, on the Macintosh, the
special menus would be .menubar.apple, .menubar.window and
.menubar.help; on Windows, the special menu would be .menubar.system; on
X Windows, the help menu would be .menubar.help.</p>
<p>When Tk sees a .menubar.apple menu as the first menu in a menubar on the
Macintosh, that menu\'s contents make up the first items of the
Application menu whenever the window containing the menubar is in front.
After all of the Tk-defined items, the menu will have a separator,
followed by all standard Application menu items. Such a .apple menu must
be present in a menu when that menu is first configured as a toplevel\'s
menubar, otherwise a default application menu (hidden from Tk) will be
inserted into the menubar at that time and subsequent addition of a
.apple menu will no longer result in it becoming the Application menu.</p>
<p>When Tk sees a .menubar.window menu on the Macintosh, the menu\'s
contents are inserted into the standard Window menu of the user\'s
menubar whenever the window\'s menubar is in front. The first items in
the menu are provided by Mac OS X, and the names of the current
toplevels are automatically appended after all the Tk-defined items and
a separator. The Window menu on the Mac also allows toggling the window
into a fullscreen state, and managing a tabbed window interface
(multiple windows grouped into a single window) if supported by that
version of the operating system.</p>
<p>When Tk sees a .menubar.help menu on the Macintosh, the menu\'s contents
are appended to the standard Help menu of the user\'s menubar whenever
the window\'s menubar is in front. The first items in the menu are
provided by Mac OS X.</p>
<p>When Tk sees a System menu on Windows, its items are appended to the
system menu that the menubar is attached to. This menu is tied to the
application icon and can be invoked with the mouse or by typing
Alt+Spacebar. Due to limitations in the Windows API, any font changes,
colors, images, bitmaps, or tearoff images will not appear in the system
menu.</p>
<p>When Tk sees a Help menu on X Windows and Motif menu compatibility is
enabled the menu is moved to be last in the menubar and is right
justified. Motif menu compatibility is enabled by setting the Tk option
<strong>*Menu.useMotifHelp</strong> to true or by calling <strong>tk::classic::restore
menu</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="clones">CLONES</h1>
<p>When a menu is set as a menubar for a toplevel window, or when a menu is
torn off, a clone of the menu is made. This clone is a menu widget in
its own right, but it is a child of the original. Changes in the
configuration of the original are reflected in the clone. Additionally,
any cascades that are pointed to are also cloned so that menu traversal
will work right. Clones are destroyed when either the tearoff or menubar
goes away, or when the original menu is destroyed.</p>
<h1 id="widget-command">WIDGET COMMAND</h1>
<p>The <strong>menu</strong> command creates a new Tcl command whose name is <em>pathName</em>.
This command may be used to invoke various operations on the widget. It
has the following general form:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>pathName option ?arg arg ...?
</code></pre></div>
<p><em>Option</em> and the <em>arg</em>s determine the exact behavior of the command.</p>
<p>Many of the widget commands for a menu take as one argument an indicator
of which entry of the menu to operate on. These indicators are called
<em>index</em>es and may be specified in any of the following forms:</p>
<p><strong>active</strong></p>
<p>:   Indicates the entry that is currently active. If no entry is active
    then this form is equivalent to <strong>none</strong>. This form may not be
    abbreviated.</p>
<p><strong>end</strong></p>
<p>:   Indicates the bottommost entry in the menu. If there are no entries
    in the menu then this form is equivalent to <strong>none</strong>. This form may
    not be abbreviated.</p>
<p><strong>last</strong></p>
<p>:   Same as <strong>end</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>none</strong></p>
<p>:   Indicates this is used most commonly with the <strong>activate</strong> option to
    deactivate all the entries in the menu. In most cases the
    specification of <strong>none</strong> causes nothing to happen in the widget
    command. This form may not be abbreviated.</p>
<p><strong>@</strong><em>number</em></p>
<p>:   In this form, <em>number</em> is treated as a y-coordinate in the menu\'s
    window; the entry closest to that y-coordinate is used. For example,
    indicates the top-most entry in the window.</p>
<p><em>number</em></p>
<p>:   Specifies the entry numerically, where 0 corresponds to the top-most
    entry of the menu, 1 to the entry below it, and so on.</p>
<p><em>pattern</em></p>
<p>:   If the index does not satisfy one of the above forms then this form
    is used. <em>Pattern</em> is pattern-matched against the label of each
    entry in the menu, in order from the top down, until a matching
    entry is found. The rules of <strong>string match</strong> are used.</p>
<p>If the index could match more than one of the above forms, then the form
earlier in the above list takes precedence.</p>
<p>The following widget commands are possible for menu widgets:</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>activate </strong><em>index</em></p>
<p>:   Change the state of the entry indicated by <em>index</em> to <strong>active</strong> and
    redisplay it using its active colors. Any previously-active entry is
    deactivated. If <em>index</em> is specified as <strong>none</strong>, or if the
    specified entry is disabled, then the menu ends up with no active
    entry. Returns an empty string.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>add </strong><em>type </em>?<em>option value option value ...</em>?</p>
<p>:   Add a new entry to the bottom of the menu. The new entry\'s type is
    given by <em>type</em> and must be one of <strong>cascade</strong>, <strong>checkbutton</strong>,
    <strong>command</strong>, <strong>radiobutton</strong>, or <strong>separator</strong>, or a unique
    abbreviation of one of the above. If additional arguments are
    present, they specify the options listed in the <strong>MENU ENTRY
    OPTIONS</strong> section below. The <strong>add</strong> widget command returns an empty
    string.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>cget </strong><em>option</em></p>
<p>:   Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
    <em>option</em>. <em>Option</em> may have any of the values accepted by the
    <strong>menu</strong> command.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>clone </strong><em>newPathname</em> ?<em>cloneType</em>?</p>
<p>:   Makes a clone of the current menu named <em>newPathName</em>. This clone is
    a menu in its own right, but any changes to the clone are propagated
    to the original menu and vice versa. <em>cloneType</em> can be <strong>normal</strong>,
    <strong>menubar</strong>, or <strong>tearoff</strong>. Should not normally be called outside
    of the Tk library. See the <strong>CLONES</strong> section for more information.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>configure</strong> ?<em>option</em>? ?<em>value option value ...</em>?</p>
<p>:   Query or modify the configuration options of the widget. If no
    <em>option</em> is specified, returns a list describing all of the
    available options for <em>pathName</em> (see <strong>Tk_ConfigureInfo</strong> for
    information on the format of this list). If <em>option</em> is specified
    with no <em>value</em>, then the command returns a list describing the one
    named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
    sublist of the value returned if no <em>option</em> is specified). If one
    or more <em>option-value</em> pairs are specified, then the command
    modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s); in
    this case the command returns an empty string. <em>Option</em> may have any
    of the values accepted by the <strong>menu</strong> command.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>delete </strong><em>index1</em> ?<em>index2</em>?</p>
<p>:   Delete all of the menu entries between <em>index1</em> and <em>index2</em>
    inclusive. If <em>index2</em> is omitted then it defaults to <em>index1</em>.
    Attempts to delete a tear-off menu entry are ignored (instead, you
    should change the <strong>-tearoff</strong> option to remove the tear-off entry).</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>entrycget </strong><em>index option</em></p>
<p>:   Returns the current value of a configuration option for the entry
    given by <em>index</em>. <em>Option</em> may have any of the names described in
    the <strong>MENU ENTRY OPTIONS</strong> section below.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>entryconfigure </strong><em>index </em>?<em>options...</em>?</p>
<p>:   This command is similar to the <strong>configure</strong> command, except that it
    applies to the options for an individual entry, whereas
    <strong>configure</strong> applies to the options for the menu as a whole.
    <em>Options</em> may have any of the values described in the <strong>MENU ENTRY
    OPTIONS</strong> section below. If <em>options</em> are specified, options are
    modified as indicated in the command and the command returns an
    empty string. If no <em>options</em> are specified, returns a list
    describing the current options for entry <em>index</em> (see
    <strong>Tk_ConfigureInfo</strong> for information on the format of this list).</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>index </strong><em>index</em></p>
<p>:   Returns the numerical index corresponding to <em>index</em>, or <strong>none</strong> if
    <em>index</em> was specified as <strong>none</strong>.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>insert </strong><em>index type </em>?<em>option value option value ...</em>?</p>
<p>:   Same as the <strong>add</strong> widget command except that it inserts the new
    entry just before the entry given by <em>index</em>, instead of appending
    to the end of the menu. The <em>type</em>, <em>option</em>, and <em>value</em> arguments
    have the same interpretation as for the <strong>add</strong> widget command. It
    is not possible to insert new menu entries before the tear-off
    entry, if the menu has one.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>invoke </strong><em>index</em></p>
<p>:   Invoke the action of the menu entry. See the sections on the
    individual entries above for details on what happens. If the menu
    entry is disabled then nothing happens. If the entry has a command
    associated with it then the result of that command is returned as
    the result of the <strong>invoke</strong> widget command. Otherwise the result is
    an empty string. Note: invoking a menu entry does not automatically
    unpost the menu; the default bindings normally take care of this
    before invoking the <strong>invoke</strong> widget command.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>post </strong><em>x y</em> ?<em>index</em>?</p>
<p>:   Arrange for the menu to be displayed on the screen at the
    root-window coordinates given by <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>. If an index is
    specified the menu will be located so that the entry with that index
    is displayed at the point. These coordinates are adjusted if
    necessary to guarantee that the entire menu is visible on the
    screen. This command normally returns an empty string. If the
    <strong>-postcommand</strong> option has been specified, then its value is
    executed as a Tcl script before posting the menu and the result of
    that script is returned as the result of the <strong>post</strong> widget
    command. If an error returns while executing the command, then the
    error is returned without posting the menu.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>postcascade </strong><em>index</em></p>
<p>:   Posts the submenu associated with the cascade entry given by
    <em>index</em>, and unposts any previously posted submenu. If <em>index</em> does
    not correspond to a cascade entry, or if <em>pathName</em> is not posted,
    the command has no effect except to unpost any currently posted
    submenu.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>type </strong><em>index</em></p>
<p>:   Returns the type of the menu entry given by <em>index</em>. This is the
    <em>type</em> argument passed to the <strong>add</strong> or <strong>insert</strong> widget command
    when the entry was created, such as <strong>command</strong> or <strong>separator</strong>, or
    <strong>tearoff</strong> for a tear-off entry.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>unpost</strong></p>
<p>:   Unmap the window so that it is no longer displayed. If a lower-level
    cascaded menu is posted, unpost that menu. Returns an empty string.
    This subcommand does not work on Windows and the Macintosh, as those
    platforms have their own way of unposting menus.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>xposition </strong><em>index</em></p>
<p>:   Returns a decimal string giving the x-coordinate within the menu
    window of the leftmost pixel in the entry specified by <em>index</em>.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>yposition </strong><em>index</em></p>
<p>:   Returns a decimal string giving the y-coordinate within the menu
    window of the topmost pixel in the entry specified by <em>index</em>.</p>
<h1 id="menu-entry-options">MENU ENTRY OPTIONS</h1>
<p>The following options are allowed on menu entries. Most options are not
supported by all entry types.</p>
<p><strong>-activebackground </strong><em>value</em></p>
<p>:   Specifies a background color to use for displaying this entry when
    it is active. This option is ignored on Aqua/MacOS. If it is
    specified as an empty string (the default), then the
    <strong>-activebackground</strong> option for the overall menu is used. If the
    <strong>tk_strictMotif</strong> variable has been set to request strict Motif
    compliance, then this option is ignored and the <strong>-background</strong>
    option is used in its place. This option is not available for
    separator or tear-off entries.</p>
<p><strong>-activeforeground </strong><em>value</em></p>
<p>:   Specifies a foreground color to use for displaying this entry when
    it is active. This option is ignored on Aqua/macOS. If this option
    is specified as an empty string (the default), then the
    <strong>-activeforeground</strong> option for the overall menu is used. This
    option is not available for separator or tear-off entries.</p>
<p><strong>-accelerator </strong><em>value</em></p>
<p>:   Specifies a string to display at the right side of the menu entry.
    Normally describes an accelerator keystroke sequence that may be
    used to invoke the same function as the menu entry. This is a
    display option, it does not actually set the corresponding binding
    (which can be achieved using the <strong>bind</strong> command). This option is
    not available for separator or tear-off entries.</p>
<p><strong>-background </strong><em>value</em></p>
<p>:   Specifies a background color to use for displaying this entry when
    it is in the normal state (neither active nor disabled). This option
    is ignored on Aqua/macOS. If it is specified as an empty string (the
    default), then the <strong>-background</strong> option for the overall menu is
    used. This option is not available for separator or tear-off
    entries.</p>
<p><strong>-bitmap </strong><em>value</em></p>
<p>:   Specifies a bitmap to display in the menu instead of a textual
    label, in any of the forms accepted by <strong>Tk_GetBitmap</strong>. This option
    overrides the <strong>-label</strong> option (as controlled by the <strong>-compound</strong>
    option) but may be reset to an empty string to enable a textual
    label to be displayed. If a <strong>-image</strong> option has been specified, it
    overrides <strong>-bitmap</strong>. This option is not available for separator or
    tear-off entries.</p>
<p><strong>-columnbreak </strong><em>value</em></p>
<p>:   When this option is zero, the entry appears below the previous
    entry. When this option is one, the entry appears at the top of a
    new column in the menu. This option is ignored on Aqua/macOS, where
    menus are always a single column.</p>
<p><strong>-command </strong><em>value</em></p>
<p>:   Specifies a Tcl command to execute when the menu entry is invoked.
    Not available for separator or tear-off entries.</p>
<p><strong>-compound </strong><em>value</em></p>
<p>:   Specifies whether the menu entry should display both an image and
    text, and if so, where the image should be placed relative to the
    text. Valid values for this option are <strong>bottom</strong>, <strong>center</strong>,
    <strong>left</strong>, <strong>none</strong>, <strong>right</strong> and <strong>top</strong>. The default value is
    <strong>none</strong>, meaning that the button will display either an image or
    text, depending on the values of the <strong>-image</strong> and <strong>-bitmap</strong>
    options.</p>
<p><strong>-font </strong><em>value</em></p>
<p>:   Specifies the font to use when drawing the label or accelerator
    string in this entry. If this option is specified as an empty string
    (the default) then the <strong>-font</strong> option for the overall menu is
    used. This option is not available for separator or tear-off
    entries.</p>
<p><strong>-foreground </strong><em>value</em></p>
<p>:   Specifies a foreground color to use for displaying this entry when
    it is in the normal state (neither active nor disabled). This option
    is ignored on Aqua/macOS. If it is specified as an empty string (the
    default), then the <strong>-foreground</strong> option for the overall menu is
    used. This option is not available for separator or tear-off
    entries.</p>
<p><strong>-hidemargin </strong><em>value</em></p>
<p>:   Specifies whether the standard margins should be drawn for this menu
    entry. This is useful when creating palette with images in them,
    i.e., color palettes, pattern palettes, etc. 1 indicates that the
    margin for the entry is hidden; 0 means that the margin is used.</p>
<p><strong>-image </strong><em>value</em></p>
<p>:   Specifies an image to display in the menu instead of a text string
    or bitmap. The image must have been created by some previous
    invocation of <strong>image create</strong>. This option overrides the <strong>-label</strong>
    and <strong>-bitmap</strong> options (as controlled by the <strong>-compound</strong> option)
    but may be reset to an empty string to enable a textual or bitmap
    label to be displayed. This option is not available for separator or
    tear-off entries.</p>
<p><strong>-indicatoron </strong><em>value</em></p>
<p>:   Available only for checkbutton and radiobutton entries. <em>Value</em> is a
    boolean that determines whether or not the indicator should be
    displayed.</p>
<p><strong>-label </strong><em>value</em></p>
<p>:   Specifies a string to display as an identifying label in the menu
    entry. Not available for separator or tear-off entries.</p>
<p><strong>-menu </strong><em>value</em></p>
<p>:   Available only for cascade entries. Specifies the path name of the
    submenu associated with this entry. The submenu must be a child of
    the menu.</p>
<p><strong>-offvalue </strong><em>value</em></p>
<p>:   Available only for checkbutton entries. Specifies the value to store
    in the entry\'s associated variable when the entry is deselected.</p>
<p><strong>-onvalue </strong><em>value</em></p>
<p>:   Available only for checkbutton entries. Specifies the value to store
    in the entry\'s associated variable when the entry is selected.</p>
<p><strong>-selectcolor </strong><em>value</em></p>
<p>:   Available only for checkbutton and radiobutton entries. Specifies
    the color to display in the indicator when the entry is selected. If
    the value is an empty string (the default) then the <strong>-selectcolor</strong>
    option for the menu determines the indicator color.</p>
<p><strong>-selectimage </strong><em>value</em></p>
<p>:   Available only for checkbutton and radiobutton entries. Specifies an
    image to display in the entry (in place of the <strong>-image</strong> option)
    when it is selected. <em>Value</em> is the name of an image, which must
    have been created by some previous invocation of <strong>image create</strong>.
    This option is ignored unless the <strong>-image</strong> option has been
    specified.</p>
<p><strong>-state </strong><em>value</em></p>
<p>:   Specifies one of three states for the entry: <strong>normal</strong>, <strong>active</strong>,
    or <strong>disabled</strong>. In normal state the entry is displayed using the
    <strong>-foreground</strong> option for the menu and the <strong>-background</strong> option
    from the entry or the menu. The active state is typically used when
    the pointer is over the entry. In active state the entry is
    displayed using the <strong>-activeforeground</strong> option for the menu along
    with the <strong>-activebackground</strong> option from the entry. Disabled state
    means that the entry should be insensitive: the default bindings
    will refuse to activate or invoke the entry. In this state the entry
    is displayed according to the <strong>-disabledforeground</strong> option for the
    menu and the <strong>-background</strong> option from the entry. This option is
    not available for separator entries.</p>
<p><strong>-underline </strong><em>value</em></p>
<p>:   Specifies the integer index of a character to underline in the
    entry. This option is also queried by the default bindings and used
    to implement keyboard traversal. 0 corresponds to the first
    character of the text displayed in the entry, 1 to the next
    character, and so on. If a bitmap or image is displayed in the entry
    then this option is ignored. This option is not available for
    separator or tear-off entries.</p>
<p><strong>-value </strong><em>value</em></p>
<p>:   Available only for radiobutton entries. Specifies the value to store
    in the entry\'s associated variable when the entry is selected. If
    an empty string is specified, then the <strong>-label</strong> option for the
    entry as the value to store in the variable.</p>
<p><strong>-variable </strong><em>value</em></p>
<p>:   Available only for checkbutton and radiobutton entries. Specifies
    the name of a global variable to set when the entry is selected. For
    checkbutton entries the variable is also set when the entry is
    deselected. For radiobutton entries, changing the variable causes
    the currently-selected entry to deselect itself.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>For checkbutton entries, the default value of this option is taken
from the **-label** option, and for radiobutton entries a single
fixed value is used. It is recommended that you always set the
**-variable** option when creating either a checkbutton or a
radiobutton.
</code></pre></div>
<h1 id="menu-configurations">MENU CONFIGURATIONS</h1>
<p>The default bindings support four different ways of using menus:</p>
<p><strong>Pulldown Menus in Menubar</strong></p>
<p>:   This is the most common case. You create a menu widget that will
    become the menu bar. You then add cascade entries to this menu,
    specifying the pull down menus you wish to use in your menu bar. You
    then create all of the pulldowns. Once you have done this, specify
    the menu using the <strong>-menu</strong> option of the toplevel\'s widget
    command. See the <strong>toplevel</strong> manual entry for details.</p>
<p><strong>Pulldown Menus in Menu Buttons</strong></p>
<p>:   This is the compatible way to do menu bars. You create one
    menubutton widget for each top-level menu, and typically you arrange
    a series of menubuttons in a row in a menubar window. You also
    create the top-level menus and any cascaded submenus, and tie them
    together with <strong>-menu</strong> options in menubuttons and cascade menu
    entries. The top-level menu must be a child of the menubutton, and
    each submenu must be a child of the menu that refers to it. Once you
    have done this, the default bindings will allow users to traverse
    and invoke the tree of menus via its menubutton; see the
    <strong>menubutton</strong> manual entry for details.</p>
<p><strong>Popup Menus</strong></p>
<p>:   Popup menus typically post in response to a mouse button press or
    keystroke. You create the popup menus and any cascaded submenus,
    then you call the <strong>tk_popup</strong> procedure at the appropriate time to
    post the top-level menu.</p>
<p><strong>Option Menus</strong></p>
<p>:   An option menu consists of a menubutton with an associated menu that
    allows you to select one of several values. The current value is
    displayed in the menubutton and is also stored in a global variable.
    Use the <strong>tk_optionMenu</strong> procedure to create option menubuttons and
    their menus.</p>
<p><strong>Torn-off Menus</strong></p>
<p>:   You create a torn-off menu by invoking the tear-off entry at the top
    of an existing menu. The default bindings will create a new menu
    that is a copy of the original menu and leave it permanently posted
    as a top-level window. The torn-off menu behaves just the same as
    the original menu.</p>
<h1 id="default-bindings">DEFAULT BINDINGS</h1>
<p>Tk automatically creates class bindings for menus that give them the
following default behavior:</p>
<p>[1]</p>
<p>:   When the mouse enters a menu, the entry underneath the mouse cursor
    activates; as the mouse moves around the menu, the active entry
    changes to track the mouse.</p>
<p>[2]</p>
<p>:   When the mouse leaves a menu all of the entries in the menu
    deactivate, except in the special case where the mouse moves from a
    menu to a cascaded submenu.</p>
<p>[3]</p>
<p>:   When a button is released over a menu, the active entry (if any) is
    invoked. The menu also unposts unless it is a torn-off menu.</p>
<p>[4]</p>
<p>:   The Space and Return keys invoke the active entry and unpost the
    menu.</p>
<p>[5]</p>
<p>:   If any of the entries in a menu have letters underlined with the
    <strong>-underline</strong> option, then pressing one of the underlined letters
    (or its upper-case or lower-case equivalent) invokes that entry and
    unposts the menu.</p>
<p>[6]</p>
<p>:   The Escape key aborts a menu selection in progress without invoking
    any entry. It also unposts the menu unless it is a torn-off menu.</p>
<p>[7]</p>
<p>:   The Up and Down keys activate the next higher or lower entry in the
    menu. When one end of the menu is reached, the active entry wraps
    around to the other end.</p>
<p>[8]</p>
<p>:   The Left key moves to the next menu to the left. If the current menu
    is a cascaded submenu, then the submenu is unposted and the current
    menu entry becomes the cascade entry in the parent. If the current
    menu is a top-level menu posted from a menubutton, then the current
    menubutton is unposted and the next menubutton to the left is
    posted. Otherwise the key has no effect. The left-right order of
    menubuttons is determined by their stacking order: Tk assumes that
    the lowest menubutton (which by default is the first one created) is
    on the left.</p>
<p>[9]</p>
<p>:   The Right key moves to the next menu to the right. If the current
    entry is a cascade entry, then the submenu is posted and the current
    menu entry becomes the first entry in the submenu. Otherwise, if the
    current menu was posted from a menubutton, then the current
    menubutton is unposted and the next menubutton to the right is
    posted.</p>
<p>Disabled menu entries are non-responsive: they do not activate and they
ignore mouse button presses and releases.</p>
<p>Several of the bindings make use of the command <strong>tk_menuSetFocus</strong>. It
saves the current focus and sets the focus to its <em>pathName</em> argument,
which is a menu widget.</p>
<p>The behavior of menus can be changed by defining new bindings for
individual widgets or by redefining the class bindings.</p>
<h1 id="bugs">BUGS</h1>
<p>At present it is not possible to use the option database to specify
values for the options to individual entries.</p>
