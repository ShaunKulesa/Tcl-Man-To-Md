<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>scrollbar</strong> command creates a new window (given by the <em>pathName</em>
argument) and makes it into a scrollbar widget. Additional options,
described above, may be specified on the command line or in the option
database to configure aspects of the scrollbar such as its colors,
orientation, and relief. The <strong>scrollbar</strong> command returns its
<em>pathName</em> argument. At the time this command is invoked, there must not
exist a window named <em>pathName</em>, but <em>pathName</em>\'s parent must exist.</p>
<p>A scrollbar is a widget that displays two arrows, one at each end of the
scrollbar, and a <em>slider</em> in the middle portion of the scrollbar. It
provides information about what is visible in an <em>associated window</em>
that displays a document of some sort (such as a file being edited or a
drawing). The position and size of the slider indicate which portion of
the document is visible in the associated window. For example, if the
slider in a vertical scrollbar covers the top third of the area between
the two arrows, it means that the associated window displays the top
third of its document.</p>
<p>Scrollbars can be used to adjust the view in the associated window by
clicking or dragging with the mouse. See the <strong>BINDINGS</strong> section below
for details.</p>
<h1 id="elements">ELEMENTS</h1>
<p>A scrollbar displays five elements, which are referred to in the widget
commands for the scrollbar:</p>
<p><strong>arrow1</strong></p>
<p>:   The top or left arrow in the scrollbar.</p>
<p><strong>trough1</strong></p>
<p>:   The region between the slider and <strong>arrow1</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>slider</strong></p>
<p>:   The rectangle that indicates what is visible in the associated
    widget.</p>
<p><strong>trough2</strong></p>
<p>:   The region between the slider and <strong>arrow2</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>arrow2</strong></p>
<p>:   The bottom or right arrow in the scrollbar.</p>
<h1 id="widget-command">WIDGET COMMAND</h1>
<p>The <strong>scrollbar</strong> command creates a new Tcl command whose name is
<em>pathName</em>. This command may be used to invoke various operations on the
widget. It has the following general form:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>pathName option ?arg arg ...?
</code></pre></div>
<p><em>Option</em> and the <em>arg</em>s determine the exact behavior of the command. The
following commands are possible for scrollbar widgets:</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>activate </strong>?<em>element</em>?</p>
<p>:   Marks the element indicated by <em>element</em> as active, which causes it
    to be displayed as specified by the <strong>-activebackground</strong> and
    <strong>-activerelief</strong> options. The only element values understood by
    this command are <strong>arrow1</strong>, <strong>slider</strong>, or <strong>arrow2</strong>. If any other
    value is specified then no element of the scrollbar will be active.
    If <em>element</em> is not specified, the command returns the name of the
    element that is currently active, or an empty string if no element
    is active.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>cget </strong><em>option</em></p>
<p>:   Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
    <em>option</em>. <em>Option</em> may have any of the values accepted by the
    <strong>scrollbar</strong> command.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>configure</strong> ?<em>option</em>? ?<em>value option value ...</em>?</p>
<p>:   Query or modify the configuration options of the widget. If no
    <em>option</em> is specified, returns a list describing all of the
    available options for <em>pathName</em> (see <strong>Tk_ConfigureInfo</strong> for
    information on the format of this list). If <em>option</em> is specified
    with no <em>value</em>, then the command returns a list describing the one
    named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
    sublist of the value returned if no <em>option</em> is specified). If one
    or more <em>option-value</em> pairs are specified, then the command
    modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s); in
    this case the command returns an empty string. <em>Option</em> may have any
    of the values accepted by the <strong>scrollbar</strong> command.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>delta </strong><em>deltaX deltaY</em></p>
<p>:   Returns a real number indicating the fractional change in the
    scrollbar setting that corresponds to a given change in slider
    position. For example, if the scrollbar is horizontal, the result
    indicates how much the scrollbar setting must change to move the
    slider <em>deltaX</em> pixels to the right (<em>deltaY</em> is ignored in this
    case). If the scrollbar is vertical, the result indicates how much
    the scrollbar setting must change to move the slider <em>deltaY</em> pixels
    down. The arguments and the result may be zero or negative.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>fraction </strong><em>x y</em></p>
<p>:   Returns a real number between 0 and 1 indicating where the point
    given by <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> lies in the trough area of the scrollbar. The
    value 0 corresponds to the top or left of the trough, the value 1
    corresponds to the bottom or right, 0.5 corresponds to the middle,
    and so on. <em>X</em> and <em>y</em> must be pixel coordinates relative to the
    scrollbar widget. If <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> refer to a point outside the
    trough, the closest point in the trough is used.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>get</strong></p>
<p>:   Returns the scrollbar settings in the form of a list whose elements
    are the arguments to the most recent <strong>set</strong> widget command.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>identify </strong><em>x y</em></p>
<p>:   Returns the name of the element under the point given by <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>
    (such as <strong>arrow1</strong>), or an empty string if the point does not lie
    in any element of the scrollbar. <em>X</em> and <em>y</em> must be pixel
    coordinates relative to the scrollbar widget.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>set </strong><em>first last</em></p>
<p>:   This command is invoked by the scrollbar\'s associated widget to
    tell the scrollbar about the current view in the widget. The command
    takes two arguments, each of which is a real fraction between 0
    and 1. The fractions describe the range of the document that is
    visible in the associated widget. For example, if <em>first</em> is 0.2 and
    <em>last</em> is 0.4, it means that the first part of the document visible
    in the window is 20% of the way through the document, and the last
    visible part is 40% of the way through.</p>
<h1 id="scrolling-commands">SCROLLING COMMANDS</h1>
<p>When the user interacts with the scrollbar, for example by dragging the
slider, the scrollbar notifies the associated widget that it must change
its view. The scrollbar makes the notification by evaluating a Tcl
command generated from the scrollbar\'s <strong>-command</strong> option. The command
may take any of the following forms. In each case, <em>prefix</em> is the
contents of the <strong>-command</strong> option, which usually has a form like</p>
<p><em>prefix </em><strong>moveto </strong><em>fraction</em></p>
<p>:   <em>Fraction</em> is a real number between 0 and 1. The widget should
    adjust its view so that the point given by <em>fraction</em> appears at the
    beginning of the widget. If <em>fraction</em> is 0 it refers to the
    beginning of the document. 1.0 refers to the end of the document,
    0.333 refers to a point one-third of the way through the document,
    and so on.</p>
<p><em>prefix </em><strong>scroll </strong><em>number </em><strong>units</strong></p>
<p>:   The widget should adjust its view by <em>number</em> units. The units are
    defined in whatever way makes sense for the widget, such as
    characters or lines in a text widget. <em>Number</em> is either 1, which
    means one unit should scroll off the top or left of the window, or
    -1, which means that one unit should scroll off the bottom or right
    of the window.</p>
<p><em>prefix </em><strong>scroll </strong><em>number </em><strong>pages</strong></p>
<p>:   The widget should adjust its view by <em>number</em> pages. It is up to the
    widget to define the meaning of a page; typically it is slightly
    less than what fits in the window, so that there is a slight overlap
    between the old and new views. <em>Number</em> is either 1, which means the
    next page should become visible, or -1, which means that the
    previous page should become visible.</p>
<h1 id="old-command-syntax">OLD COMMAND SYNTAX</h1>
<p>In versions of Tk before 4.0, the <strong>set</strong> and <strong>get</strong> widget commands
used a different form. This form is still supported for backward
compatibility, but it is deprecated. In the old command syntax, the
<strong>set</strong> widget command has the following form:</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>set </strong><em>totalUnits windowUnits firstUnit lastUnit</em></p>
<p>:   In this form the arguments are all integers. <em>TotalUnits</em> gives the
    total size of the object being displayed in the associated widget.
    The meaning of one unit depends on the associated widget; for
    example, in a text editor widget units might correspond to lines of
    text. <em>WindowUnits</em> indicates the total number of units that can fit
    in the associated window at one time. <em>FirstUnit</em> and <em>lastUnit</em>
    give the indices of the first and last units currently visible in
    the associated window (zero corresponds to the first unit of the
    object).</p>
<p>Under the old syntax the <strong>get</strong> widget command returns a list of four
integers, consisting of the <em>totalUnits</em>, <em>windowUnits</em>, <em>firstUnit</em>,
and <em>lastUnit</em> values from the last <strong>set</strong> widget command.</p>
<p>The commands generated by scrollbars also have a different form when the
old syntax is being used:</p>
<p><em>prefix</em> <em>unit</em></p>
<p>:   <em>Unit</em> is an integer that indicates what should appear at the top or
    left of the associated widget\'s window. It has the same meaning as
    the <em>firstUnit</em> and <em>lastUnit</em> arguments to the <strong>set</strong> widget
    command.</p>
<p>The most recent <strong>set</strong> widget command determines whether or not to use
the old syntax. If it is given two real arguments then the new syntax
will be used in the future, and if it is given four integer arguments
then the old syntax will be used.</p>
<h1 id="bindings">BINDINGS</h1>
<p>Tk automatically creates class bindings for scrollbars that give them
the following default behavior. If the behavior is different for
vertical and horizontal scrollbars, the horizontal behavior is described
in parentheses.</p>
<p>[1]</p>
<p>:   Pressing button 1 over <strong>arrow1</strong> causes the view in the associated
    widget to shift up (left) by one unit so that the document appears
    to move down (right) one unit. If the button is held down, the
    action auto-repeats.</p>
<p>[2]</p>
<p>:   Pressing button 1 over <strong>trough1</strong> causes the view in the associated
    widget to shift up (left) by one screenful so that the document
    appears to move down (right) one screenful. If the button is held
    down, the action auto-repeats.</p>
<p>[3]</p>
<p>:   Pressing button 1 over the slider and dragging causes the view to
    drag with the slider. If the <strong>jump</strong> option is true, then the view
    does not drag along with the slider; it changes only when the mouse
    button is released.</p>
<p>[4]</p>
<p>:   Pressing button 1 over <strong>trough2</strong> causes the view in the associated
    widget to shift down (right) by one screenful so that the document
    appears to move up (left) one screenful. If the button is held down,
    the action auto-repeats.</p>
<p>[5]</p>
<p>:   Pressing button 1 over <strong>arrow2</strong> causes the view in the associated
    widget to shift down (right) by one unit so that the document
    appears to move up (left) one unit. If the button is held down, the
    action auto-repeats.</p>
<p>[6]</p>
<p>:   If button 2 is pressed over the trough or the slider, it sets the
    view to correspond to the mouse position; dragging the mouse with
    button 2 down causes the view to drag with the mouse. If button 2 is
    pressed over one of the arrows, it causes the same behavior as
    pressing button 1.</p>
<p>[7]</p>
<p>:   If button 1 is pressed with the Control key down, then if the mouse
    is over <strong>arrow1</strong> or <strong>trough1</strong> the view changes to the very top
    (left) of the document; if the mouse is over <strong>arrow2</strong> or
    <strong>trough2</strong> the view changes to the very bottom (right) of the
    document; if the mouse is anywhere else then the button press has no
    effect.</p>
<p>[8]</p>
<p>:   In vertical scrollbars the Up and Down keys have the same behavior
    as mouse clicks over <strong>arrow1</strong> and <strong>arrow2</strong>, respectively. In
    horizontal scrollbars these keys have no effect.</p>
<p>[9]</p>
<p>:   In vertical scrollbars Control-Up and Control-Down have the same
    behavior as mouse clicks over <strong>trough1</strong> and <strong>trough2</strong>,
    respectively. In horizontal scrollbars these keys have no effect.</p>
<p>[10]</p>
<p>:   In horizontal scrollbars the Up and Down keys have the same behavior
    as mouse clicks over <strong>arrow1</strong> and <strong>arrow2</strong>, respectively. In
    vertical scrollbars these keys have no effect.</p>
<p>[11]</p>
<p>:   In horizontal scrollbars Control-Up and Control-Down have the same
