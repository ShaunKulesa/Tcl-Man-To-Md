<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>listbox</strong> command creates a new window (given by the <em>pathName</em>
argument) and makes it into a listbox widget. Additional options,
described above, may be specified on the command line or in the option
database to configure aspects of the listbox such as its colors, font,
text, and relief. The <strong>listbox</strong> command returns its <em>pathName</em>
argument. At the time this command is invoked, there must not exist a
window named <em>pathName</em>, but <em>pathName</em>\'s parent must exist.</p>
<p>A listbox is a widget that displays a list of strings, one per line.
When first created, a new listbox has no elements. Elements may be added
or deleted using widget commands described below. In addition, one or
more elements may be selected as described below. If a listbox is
exporting its selection (see <strong>-exportselection</strong> option), then it will
observe the standard X11 protocols for handling the selection. Listbox
selections are available as type <strong>STRING</strong>; the value of the selection
will be the text of the selected elements, with newlines separating the
elements.</p>
<p>It is not necessary for all the elements to be displayed in the listbox
window at once; commands described below may be used to change the view
in the window. Listboxes allow scrolling in both directions using the
standard <strong>-xscrollcommand</strong> and <strong>-yscrollcommand</strong> options. They also
support scanning, as described below.</p>
<h1 id="indices">INDICES</h1>
<p>Many of the widget commands for listboxes take one or more indices as
arguments. An index specifies a particular element of the listbox, in
any of the following ways:</p>
<p><em>number</em></p>
<p>:   Specifies the element as a numerical index, where 0 corresponds to
    the first element in the listbox.</p>
<p><strong>active</strong></p>
<p>:   Indicates the element that has the location cursor. This element
    will be displayed as specified by <strong>-activestyle</strong> when the listbox
    has the keyboard focus, and it is specified with the <strong>activate</strong>
    widget command.</p>
<p><strong>anchor</strong></p>
<p>:   Indicates the anchor point for the selection, which is set with the
    <strong>selection anchor</strong> widget command.</p>
<p><strong>end</strong></p>
<p>:   Indicates the end of the listbox. For most commands this refers to
    the last element in the listbox, but for a few commands such as
    <strong>index</strong> and <strong>insert</strong> it refers to the element just after the
    last one.</p>
<p><strong>@</strong><em>x</em><strong>,</strong><em>y</em></p>
<p>:   Indicates the element that covers the point in the listbox window
    specified by <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> (in pixel coordinates). If no element
    covers that point, then the closest element to that point is used.</p>
<p>In the widget command descriptions below, arguments named <em>index</em>,
<em>first</em>, and <em>last</em> always contain text indices in one of the above
forms.</p>
<h1 id="widget-command">WIDGET COMMAND</h1>
<p>The <strong>listbox</strong> command creates a new Tcl command whose name is
<em>pathName</em>. This command may be used to invoke various operations on the
widget. It has the following general form:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>pathName option ?arg arg ...?
</code></pre></div>
<p><em>Option</em> and the <em>arg</em>s determine the exact behavior of the command. The
following commands are possible for listbox widgets:</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>activate</strong> <em>index</em></p>
<p>:   Sets the active element to the one indicated by <em>index</em>. If <em>index</em>
    is outside the range of elements in the listbox then the closest
    element is activated. The active element is drawn as specified by
    <strong>-activestyle</strong> when the widget has the input focus, and its index
    may be retrieved with the index <strong>active</strong>.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>bbox</strong> <em>index</em></p>
<p>:   Returns a list of four numbers describing the bounding box of the
    text in the element given by <em>index</em>. The first two elements of the
    list give the x and y coordinates of the upper-left corner of the
    screen area covered by the text (specified in pixels relative to the
    widget) and the last two elements give the width and height of the
    area, in pixels. If no part of the element given by <em>index</em> is
    visible on the screen, or if <em>index</em> refers to a non-existent
    element, then the result is an empty string; if the element is
    partially visible, the result gives the full area of the element,
    including any parts that are not visible.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>cget</strong> <em>option</em></p>
<p>:   Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
    <em>option</em>. <em>Option</em> may have any of the values accepted by the
    <strong>listbox</strong> command.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>configure</strong> ?<em>option</em>? ?<em>value option value ...</em>?</p>
<p>:   Query or modify the configuration options of the widget. If no
    <em>option</em> is specified, returns a list describing all of the
    available options for <em>pathName</em> (see <strong>Tk_ConfigureInfo</strong> for
    information on the format of this list). If <em>option</em> is specified
    with no <em>value</em>, then the command returns a list describing the one
    named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
    sublist of the value returned if no <em>option</em> is specified). If one
    or more <em>option-value</em> pairs are specified, then the command
    modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s); in
    this case the command returns an empty string. <em>Option</em> may have any
    of the values accepted by the <strong>listbox</strong> command.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>curselection</strong></p>
<p>:   Returns a list containing the numerical indices of all of the
    elements in the listbox that are currently selected. If there are no
    elements selected in the listbox then an empty string is returned.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>delete </strong><em>first </em>?<em>last</em>?</p>
<p>:   Deletes one or more elements of the listbox. <em>First</em> and <em>last</em> are
    indices specifying the first and last elements in the range to
    delete. If <em>last</em> is not specified it defaults to <em>first</em>, i.e. a
    single element is deleted.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>get </strong><em>first</em> ?<em>last</em>?</p>
<p>:   If <em>last</em> is omitted, returns the contents of the listbox element
    indicated by <em>first</em>, or an empty string if <em>first</em> refers to a
    non-existent element. If <em>last</em> is specified, the command returns a
    list whose elements are all of the listbox elements between <em>first</em>
    and <em>last</em>, inclusive. Both <em>first</em> and <em>last</em> may have any of the
    standard forms for indices.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>index </strong><em>index</em></p>
<p>:   Returns the integer index value that corresponds to <em>index</em>. If
    <em>index</em> is <strong>end</strong> the return value is a count of the number of
    elements in the listbox (not the index of the last element).</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>insert </strong><em>index </em>?<em>element element ...</em>?</p>
<p>:   Inserts zero or more new elements in the list just before the
    element given by <em>index</em>. If <em>index</em> is specified as <strong>end</strong> then
    the new elements are added to the end of the list. Returns an empty
    string.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>itemcget </strong><em>index option</em></p>
<p>:   Returns the current value of the item configuration option given by
    <em>option</em>. <em>Option</em> may have any of the values accepted by the
    <strong>itemconfigure</strong> command.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>itemconfigure </strong><em>index</em> ?<em>option</em>? ?<em>value</em>? ?<em>option value ...</em>?</p>
<p>:   Query or modify the configuration options of an item in the listbox.
    If no <em>option</em> is specified, returns a list describing all of the
    available options for the item (see <strong>Tk_ConfigureInfo</strong> for
    information on the format of this list). If <em>option</em> is specified
    with no <em>value</em>, then the command returns a list describing the one
    named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
    sublist of the value returned if no <em>option</em> is specified). If one
    or more <em>option-value</em> pairs are specified, then the command
    modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s); in
    this case the command returns an empty string. The following options
    are currently supported for items:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>**-background ***color*

:   *Color* specifies the background color to use when displaying
    the item. It may have any of the forms accepted by
    **Tk_GetColor**.

**-foreground ***color*

:   *Color* specifies the foreground color to use when displaying
    the item. It may have any of the forms accepted by
    **Tk_GetColor**.

**-selectbackground ***color*

:   *color* specifies the background color to use when displaying
    the item while it is selected. It may have any of the forms
    accepted by **Tk_GetColor**.

**-selectforeground ***color*

:   *color* specifies the foreground color to use when displaying
    the item while it is selected. It may have any of the forms
    accepted by **Tk_GetColor**.
</code></pre></div>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>nearest </strong><em>y</em></p>
<p>:   Given a y-coordinate within the listbox window, this command returns
    the index of the (visible) listbox element nearest to that
    y-coordinate.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>scan</strong> <em>option args</em></p>
<p>:   This command is used to implement scanning on listboxes. It has two
    forms, depending on <em>option</em>:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>*pathName ***scan mark ***x y*

:   Records *x* and *y* and the current view in the listbox window;
    used in conjunction with later **scan dragto** commands.
    Typically this command is associated with a mouse button press
    in the widget. It returns an empty string.

*pathName ***scan dragto ***x y*.

:   This command computes the difference between its *x* and *y*
    arguments and the *x* and *y* arguments to the last **scan
    mark** command for the widget. It then adjusts the view by 10
    times the difference in coordinates. This command is typically
    associated with mouse motion events in the widget, to produce
    the effect of dragging the list at high speed through the
    window. The return value is an empty string.
</code></pre></div>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>see </strong><em>index</em></p>
<p>:   Adjust the view in the listbox so that the element given by <em>index</em>
    is visible. If the element is already visible then the command has
    no effect; if the element is near one edge of the window then the
    listbox scrolls to bring the element into view at the edge;
    otherwise the listbox scrolls to center the element.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>selection </strong><em>option arg</em></p>
<p>:   This command is used to adjust the selection within a listbox. It
    has several forms, depending on <em>option</em>:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>*pathName ***selection anchor ***index*

:   Sets the selection anchor to the element given by *index*. If
    *index* refers to a non-existent element, then the closest
    element is used. The selection anchor is the end of the
    selection that is fixed while dragging out a selection with the
    mouse. The index **anchor** may be used to refer to the anchor
    element.

*pathName ***selection clear ***first *?*last*?

:   If any of the elements between *first* and *last* (inclusive)
    are selected, they are deselected. The selection state is not
    changed for elements outside this range.

*pathName ***selection includes ***index*

:   Returns 1 if the element indicated by *index* is currently
    selected, 0 if it is not.

*pathName ***selection set ***first *?*last*?

:   Selects all of the elements in the range between *first* and
    *last*, inclusive, without affecting the selection state of
    elements outside that range.
</code></pre></div>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>size</strong></p>
<p>:   Returns a decimal string indicating the total number of elements in
    the listbox.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>xview </strong>?<em>args</em></p>
<p>:   This command is used to query and change the horizontal position of
    the information in the widget\'s window. It can take any of the
    following forms:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>*pathName ***xview**

:   Returns a list containing two elements. Each element is a real
    fraction between 0 and 1; together they describe the horizontal
    span that is visible in the window. For example, if the first
    element is .2 and the second element is .6, 20% of the
    listbox\&#39;s text is off-screen to the left, the middle 40% is
    visible in the window, and 40% of the text is off-screen to the
    right. These are the same values passed to scrollbars via the
    **-xscrollcommand** option.

*pathName ***xview ***index*

:   Adjusts the view in the window so that the character position
    given by *index* is displayed at the left edge of the window.
    Character positions are defined by the width of the character
    **0**.

*pathName ***xview moveto*** fraction*

:   Adjusts the view in the window so that *fraction* of the total
    width of the listbox text is off-screen to the left. *fraction*
    must be a fraction between 0 and 1.

*pathName ***xview scroll ***number what*

:   This command shifts the view in the window left or right
    according to *number* and *what*. *Number* must be an integer.
    *What* must be either **units** or **pages** or an abbreviation
    of one of these. If *what* is **units**, the view adjusts left
    or right by *number* character units (the width of the **0**
    character) on the display; if it is **pages** then the view
    adjusts by *number* screenfuls. If *number* is negative then
    characters farther to the left become visible; if it is positive
    then characters farther to the right become visible.

<p><em>pathName </em><strong>yview </strong>?<em>args</em>?</p>
<p>:   This command is used to query and change the vertical position of
    the text in the widget\'s window. It can take any of the following
    forms:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>*pathName ***yview**

:   Returns a list containing two elements, both of which are real
    fractions between 0 and 1. The first element gives the position
    of the listbox element at the top of the window, relative to the
    listbox as a whole (0.5 means it is halfway through the listbox,
    for example). The second element gives the position of the
    listbox element just after the last one in the window, relative
    to the listbox as a whole. These are the same values passed to
    scrollbars via the **-yscrollcommand** option.

*pathName ***yview ***index*

:   Adjusts the view in the window so that the element given by
    *index* is displayed at the top of the window.

*pathName ***yview moveto*** fraction*

:   Adjusts the view in the window so that the element given by
    *fraction* appears at the top of the window. *Fraction* is a
    fraction between 0 and 1; 0 indicates the first element in the
    listbox, 0.33 indicates the element one-third the way through
    the listbox, and so on.

*pathName ***yview scroll ***number what*

:   This command adjusts the view in the window up or down according
    to *number* and *what*. *Number* must be an integer. *What* must
    be either **units** or **pages**. If *what* is **units**, the
    view adjusts up or down by *number* lines; if it is **pages**
    then the view adjusts by *number* screenfuls. If *number* is
    negative then earlier elements become visible; if it is positive
    then later elements become visible.

<h1 id="default-bindings">DEFAULT BINDINGS</h1>
<p>Tk automatically creates class bindings for listboxes that give them
Motif-like behavior. Much of the behavior of a listbox is determined by
its <strong>-selectmode</strong> option, which selects one of four ways of dealing
with the selection.</p>
<p>If the selection mode is <strong>single</strong> or <strong>browse</strong>, at most one element
can be selected in the listbox at once. In both modes, clicking button 1
on an element selects it and deselects any other selected item. In
<strong>browse</strong> mode it is also possible to drag the selection with button 1.
On button 1, the listbox will also take focus if it has a <strong>normal</strong>
state.</p>
<p>If the selection mode is <strong>multiple</strong> or <strong>extended</strong>, any number of
elements may be selected at once, including discontiguous ranges. In
<strong>multiple</strong> mode, clicking button 1 on an element toggles its selection
state without affecting any other elements. In <strong>extended</strong> mode,
pressing button 1 on an element selects it, deselects everything else,
and sets the anchor to the element under the mouse; dragging the mouse
with button 1 down extends the selection to include all the elements
between the anchor and the element under the mouse, inclusive.</p>
<p>Most people will probably want to use <strong>browse</strong> mode for single
selections and <strong>extended</strong> mode for multiple selections; the other
modes appear to be useful only in special situations.</p>
<p>Any time the set of selected item(s) in the listbox is updated by the
user through the keyboard or mouse, the virtual event
<strong>\&lt;\&lt;ListboxSelect>></strong> will be generated. This virtual event will not
be generated when adjusting the selection with the <em>pathName</em>
<strong>selection</strong> command. It is easiest to bind to this event to be made
aware of any user changes to listbox selection.</p>
<p>In addition to the above behavior, the following additional behavior is
defined by the default bindings:</p>
<p>[1]</p>
<p>:   In <strong>extended</strong> mode, the selected range can be adjusted by pressing
    button 1 with the Shift key down: this modifies the selection to
    consist of the elements between the anchor and the element under the
    mouse, inclusive. The un-anchored end of this new selection can also
    be dragged with the button down.</p>
<p>[2]</p>
<p>:   In <strong>extended</strong> mode, pressing button 1 with the Control key down
    starts a toggle operation: the anchor is set to the element under
    the mouse, and its selection state is reversed. The selection state
    of other elements is not changed. If the mouse is dragged with
    button 1 down, then the selection state of all elements between the
    anchor and the element under the mouse is set to match that of the
    anchor element; the selection state of all other elements remains
    what it was before the toggle operation began.</p>
<p>[3]</p>
<p>:   If the mouse leaves the listbox window with button 1 down, the
    window scrolls away from the mouse, making information visible that
    used to be off-screen on the side of the mouse. The scrolling
    continues until the mouse re-enters the window, the button is
    released, or the end of the listbox is reached.</p>
<p>[4]</p>
<p>:   Mouse button 2 may be used for scanning. If it is pressed and
    dragged over the listbox, the contents of the listbox drag at high
    speed in the direction the mouse moves.</p>
<p>[5]</p>
<p>:   If the Up or Down key is pressed, the location cursor (active
    element) moves up or down one element. If the selection mode is
    <strong>browse</strong> or <strong>extended</strong> then the new active element is also
    selected and all other elements are deselected. In <strong>extended</strong> mode
    the new active element becomes the selection anchor.</p>
<p>[6]</p>
<p>:   In <strong>extended</strong> mode, Shift-Up and Shift-Down move the location
    cursor (active element) up or down one element and also extend the
    selection to that element in a fashion similar to dragging with
    mouse button 1.</p>
<p>[7]</p>
<p>:   The Left and Right keys scroll the listbox view left and right by
    the width of the character <strong>0</strong>. Control-Left and Control-Right
    scroll the listbox view left and right by the width of the window.
    Control-Prior and Control-Next also scroll left and right by the
    width of the window.</p>
<p>[8]</p>
<p>:   The Prior and Next keys scroll the listbox view up and down by one
    page (the height of the window).</p>
<p>[9]</p>
<p>:   The Home and End keys scroll the listbox horizontally to the left
    and right edges, respectively.</p>
<p>[10]</p>
<p>:   Control-Home sets the location cursor to the first element in the
    listbox, selects that element, and deselects everything else in the
    listbox.</p>
<p>[11]</p>
<p>:   Control-End sets the location cursor to the last element in the
    listbox, selects that element, and deselects everything else in the
    listbox.</p>
<p>[12]</p>
<p>:   In <strong>extended</strong> mode, Control-Shift-Home extends the selection to
    the first element in the listbox and Control-Shift-End extends the
    selection to the last element.</p>
<p>[13]</p>
<p>:   In <strong>multiple</strong> mode, Control-Shift-Home moves the location cursor
    to the first element in the listbox and Control-Shift-End moves the
    location cursor to the last element.</p>
<p>[14]</p>
<p>:   The space and Select keys make a selection at the location cursor
    (active element) just as if mouse button 1 had been pressed over
    this element.</p>
<p>[15]</p>
<p>:   In <strong>extended</strong> mode, Control-Shift-space and Shift-Select extend
    the selection to the active element just as if button 1 had been
    pressed with the Shift key down.</p>
<p>[16]</p>
<p>:   In <strong>extended</strong> mode, the Escape key cancels the most recent
    selection and restores all the elements in the selected range to
    their previous selection state.</p>
<p>[17]</p>
<p>:   Control-slash selects everything in the widget, except in <strong>single</strong>
    and <strong>browse</strong> modes, in which case it selects the active element
    and deselects everything else.</p>
<p>[18]</p>
<p>:   Control-backslash deselects everything in the widget, except in
    <strong>browse</strong> mode where it has no effect.</p>
<p>[19]</p>
<p>:   The F16 key (labelled Copy on many Sun workstations) or Meta-w
    copies the selection in the widget to the clipboard, if there is a
    selection.</p>
<p>The behavior of listboxes can be changed by defining new bindings for
individual widgets or by redefining the class bindings.</p>
