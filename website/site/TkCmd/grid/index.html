<h1 id="name">NAME</h1>
<p>grid - Geometry manager that arranges widgets in a grid</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>grid </strong><em>option arg </em>?<em>arg ...</em>?</p>
<p>\</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>grid</strong> command is used to communicate with the grid geometry
manager that arranges widgets in rows and columns inside of another
window, called the geometry container (or container window). The
<strong>grid</strong> command can have any of several forms, depending on the
<em>option</em> argument:</p>
<p><strong>grid </strong><em>window </em>?<em>window ...</em>? ?<em>options</em>?</p>
<p>:   If the first argument to <strong>grid</strong> is suitable as the first window
    argument to <strong>grid configure</strong>, either a window name (any value
    starting with <strong>.</strong>) or one of the characters <strong>x</strong> or <strong>\^</strong> (see
    the <strong>RELATIVE PLACEMENT</strong> section below), then the command is
    processed in the same way as <strong>grid configure</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>grid anchor </strong><em>window</em> ?<em>anchor</em>?</p>
<p>:   The anchor value controls how to place the grid within the container
    window when no row/column has any weight. See <strong>THE GRID ALGORITHM</strong>
    below for further details. The default <em>anchor</em> is <em>nw</em>.</p>
<p><strong>grid bbox </strong><em>window</em> ?<em>column row</em>? ?<em>column2 row2</em>?</p>
<p>:   With no arguments, the bounding box (in pixels) of the grid is
    returned. The return value consists of 4 integers. The first two are
    the pixel offset from the container window (x then y) of the
    top-left corner of the grid, and the second two integers are the
    width and height of the grid, also in pixels. If a single <em>column</em>
    and <em>row</em> is specified on the command line, then the bounding box
    for that cell is returned, where the top left cell is numbered from
    zero. If both <em>column</em> and <em>row</em> arguments are specified, then the
    bounding box spanning the rows and columns indicated is returned.</p>
<p><strong>grid columnconfigure </strong><em>window index </em>?<em>-option value...</em>?</p>
<p>:   Query or set the column properties of the <em>index</em> column of the
    geometry container, <em>window</em>. The valid options are <strong>-minsize</strong>,
    <strong>-weight</strong>, <strong>-uniform</strong> and <strong>-pad</strong>. If one or more options are
    provided, then <em>index</em> may be given as a list of column indices to
    which the configuration options will operate on. Indices may be
    integers, window names or the keyword <em>all</em>. For <em>all</em> the options
    apply to all columns currently occupied be content windows. For a
    window name, that window must be a content of this container and the
    options apply to all columns currently occupied be the content. The
    <strong>-minsize</strong> option sets the minimum size, in screen units, that
    will be permitted for this column. The <strong>-weight</strong> option (an
    integer value) sets the relative weight for apportioning any extra
    spaces among columns. A weight of zero (0) indicates the column will
    not deviate from its requested size. A column whose weight is two
    will grow at twice the rate as a column of weight one when extra
    space is allocated to the layout. The <strong>-uniform</strong> option, when a
    non-empty value is supplied, places the column in a <em>uniform group</em>
    with other columns that have the same value for <strong>-uniform</strong>. The
    space for columns belonging to a uniform group is allocated so that
    their sizes are always in strict proportion to their <strong>-weight</strong>
    values. See <strong>THE GRID ALGORITHM</strong> below for further details. The
    <strong>-pad</strong> option specifies the number of screen units that will be
    added to the largest window contained completely in that column when
    the grid geometry manager requests a size from the containing
    window. If only an option is specified, with no value, the current
    value of that option is returned. If only the container window and
    index is specified, all the current settings are returned in a list
    of pairs.</p>
<p><strong>grid configure </strong><em>window </em>?<em>window ...</em>? ?<em>options</em>?</p>
<p>:   The arguments consist of the names of one or more content windows
    followed by pairs of arguments that specify how to manage the
    content. The characters <strong>-</strong>, <strong>x</strong> and <strong>\^</strong>, can be specified
    instead of a window name to alter the default location of a
    <em>window</em>, as described in the <strong>RELATIVE PLACEMENT</strong> section, below.
    The following options are supported:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>**-column ***n*

:   Insert the window so that it occupies the *n*th column in the
    grid. Column numbers start with 0. If this option is not
    supplied, then the window is arranged just to the right of
    previous window specified on this call to **grid**, or column if
    it is the first window. For each **x** that immediately precedes
    the *window*, the column position is incremented by one. Thus
    the **x** represents a blank column for this row in the grid.

**-columnspan ***n*

:   Insert the window so that it occupies *n* columns in the grid.
    The default is one column, unless the window name is followed by
    a **-**, in which case the columnspan is incremented once for
    each immediately following **-**.

**-in ***container*

:   Insert the window(s) in the container window given by
    *container*. The default is the first window\&#39;s parent window.

**-ipadx ***amount*

:   The *amount* specifies how much horizontal internal padding to
    leave on each side of the content. This is space is added inside
    the content border. The *amount* must be a valid screen
    distance, such as **2** or **.5c**. It defaults to 0.

**-ipady ***amount*

:   The *amount* specifies how much vertical internal padding to
    leave on the top and bottom of the content. This space is added
    inside the content border. The *amount* defaults to 0.

**-padx ***amount*

:   The *amount* specifies how much horizontal external padding to
    leave on each side of the content, in screen units. *Amount* may
    be a list of two values to specify padding for left and right
    separately. The *amount* defaults to 0. This space is added
    outside the content border.

**-pady ***amount*

:   The *amount* specifies how much vertical external padding to
    leave on the top and bottom of the content, in screen units.
    *Amount* may be a list of two values to specify padding for top
    and bottom separately. The *amount* defaults to 0. This space is
    added outside the content border.

**-row ***n*

:   Insert the content so that it occupies the *n*th row in the
    grid. Row numbers start with 0. If this option is not supplied,
    then the content is arranged on the same row as the previous
    content specified on this call to **grid**, or the next row
    after the highest occupied row if this is the first content.

**-rowspan ***n*

:   Insert the content so that it occupies *n* rows in the grid. The
    default is one row. If the next **grid** command contains **\^**
    characters instead of *content* that line up with the columns of
    this *content*, then the **rowspan** of this *content* is
    extended by one.

**-sticky ***style*

:   If a content\&#39;s cell is larger than its requested dimensions,
    this option may be used to position (or stretch) the content
    within its cell. *Style* is a string that contains zero or more
    of the characters **n**, **s**, **e** or **w**. The string can
    optionally contains spaces or commas, but they are ignored. Each
    letter refers to a side (north, south, east, or west) that the
    content will to. If both **n** and **s** (or **e** and **w**)
    are specified, the content will be stretched to fill the entire
    height (or width) of its cavity. The **-sticky** option subsumes
    the combination of **-anchor** and **-fill** that is used by
    **pack**. The default is which causes the content to be centered
    in its cavity, at its requested size.

If any of the content is already managed by the geometry manager
then any unspecified options for them retain their previous values
rather than receiving default values.
</code></pre></div>
<p><strong>grid forget </strong><em>window </em>?<em>window ...</em>?</p>
<p>:   Removes each of the <em>window</em>s from grid for its container and unmaps
    their windows. The content will no longer be managed by the grid
    geometry manager. The configuration options for that window are
    forgotten, so that if the window is managed once more by the grid
    geometry manager, the initial default settings are used.</p>
<p><strong>grid info </strong><em>window</em></p>
<p>:   Returns a list whose elements are the current configuration state of
    the content given by <em>window</em> in the same option-value form that
    might be specified to <strong>grid configure</strong>. The first two elements of
    the list are where <em>container</em> is the windows\'s container window.</p>
<p><strong>grid location </strong><em>window x y</em></p>
<p>:   Given <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> values in screen units relative to the container
    window, the column and row number at that <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> location is
    returned. For locations that are above or to the left of the grid,
    <strong>-1</strong> is returned.</p>
<p><strong>grid propagate </strong><em>window</em> ?<em>boolean</em>?</p>
<p>:   If <em>boolean</em> has a true boolean value such as <strong>1</strong> or <strong>on</strong> then
    propagation is enabled for <em>window</em>, which must be a window name
    (see <strong>GEOMETRY PROPAGATION</strong> below). If <em>boolean</em> has a false
    boolean value then propagation is disabled for <em>window</em>. In either
    of these cases an empty string is returned. If <em>boolean</em> is omitted
    then the command returns <strong>0</strong> or <strong>1</strong> to indicate whether
    propagation is currently enabled for <em>window</em>. Propagation is
    enabled by default.</p>
<p><strong>grid rowconfigure </strong><em>window index </em>?<em>-option value...</em>?</p>
<p>:   Query or set the row properties of the <em>index</em> row of the geometry
    window, <em>window</em>. The valid options are <strong>-minsize</strong>, <strong>-weight</strong>,
    <strong>-uniform</strong> and <strong>-pad</strong>. If one or more options are provided, then
    <em>index</em> may be given as a list of row indices to which the
    configuration options will operate on. Indices may be integers,
    window names or the keyword <em>all</em>. For <em>all</em> the options apply to
    all rows currently occupied by content windows. For a window name,
    that window must be a content window of this container and the
    options apply to all rows currently occupied by the container
    window. The <strong>-minsize</strong> option sets the minimum size, in screen
    units, that will be permitted for this row. The <strong>-weight</strong> option
    (an integer value) sets the relative weight for apportioning any
    extra spaces among rows. A weight of zero (0) indicates the row will
    not deviate from its requested size. A row whose weight is two will
    grow at twice the rate as a row of weight one when extra space is
    allocated to the layout. The <strong>-uniform</strong> option, when a non-empty
    value is supplied, places the row in a <em>uniform group</em> with other
    rows that have the same value for <strong>-uniform</strong>. The space for rows
    belonging to a uniform group is allocated so that their sizes are
    always in strict proportion to their <strong>-weight</strong> values. See <strong>THE
    GRID ALGORITHM</strong> below for further details. The <strong>-pad</strong> option
    specifies the number of screen units that will be added to the
    largest window contained completely in that row when the grid
    geometry manager requests a size from the containing window. If only
    an option is specified, with no value, the current value of that
    option is returned. If only the container window and index is
    specified, all the current settings are returned in a list of pairs.</p>
<p><strong>grid remove </strong><em>window </em>?<em>window ...</em>?</p>
<p>:   Removes each of the <em>window</em>s from grid for its container and unmaps
    their windows. The content will no longer be managed by the grid
    geometry manager. However, the configuration options for that window
    are remembered, so that if the content window is managed once more
    by the grid geometry manager, the previous values are retained.</p>
<p><strong>grid size </strong><em>container</em></p>
<p>:   Returns the size of the grid (in columns then rows) for <em>container</em>.
    The size is determined either by the <em>content</em> occupying the largest
    row or column, or the largest column or row with a <strong>-minsize</strong>,
    <strong>-weight</strong>, or <strong>-pad</strong> that is non-zero.</p>
<p><strong>grid slaves </strong><em>window</em> ?<em>-option value</em>?</p>
<p>:   If no options are supplied, a list of all of the content in <em>window</em>
    are returned, most recently managed first. <em>Option</em> can be either
    <strong>-row</strong> or <strong>-column</strong> which causes only the content in the row (or
    column) specified by <em>value</em> to be returned.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span id="__span-0-1"><a id="__codelineno-0-1" name="__codelineno-0-1" href="#__codelineno-0-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</span></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>grid content </strong><em>window</em> ?<em>-option value</em>?</p>
<p>:   Synonym for <strong>grid slaves </strong><em>window</em> ?<em>-option value</em>?.</p>
<h1 id="relative-placement">RELATIVE PLACEMENT</h1>
<p>The <strong>grid</strong> command contains a limited set of capabilities that permit
layouts to be created without specifying the row and column information
for each content. This permits content to be rearranged, added, or
removed without the need to explicitly specify row and column
information. When no column or row information is specified for a
<em>content</em>, default values are chosen for <strong>-column</strong>, <strong>-row</strong>,
<strong>-columnspan</strong> and <strong>-rowspan</strong> at the time the <em>content</em> is managed.
The values are chosen based upon the current layout of the grid, the
position of the <em>content</em> relative to other <em>content</em>s in the same grid
command, and the presence of the characters <strong>-</strong>, <strong>x</strong>, and <strong>\^</strong> in
<strong>grid</strong> command where <em>content</em> names are normally expected.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>-</strong></p>
<p>:   This increases the <strong>-columnspan</strong> of the <em>content</em> to the left.
    Several <strong>-</strong>\'s in a row will successively increase the number of
    columns spanned. A <strong>-</strong> may not follow a <strong>\^</strong> or a <strong>x</strong>, nor
    may it be the first <em>content</em> argument to <strong>grid configure</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>x</strong></p>
<p>:   This leaves an empty column between the <em>content</em> on the left and
    the <em>content</em> on the right.</p>
<p><strong>\^</strong></p>
<p>:   This extends the <strong>-rowspan</strong> of the <em>content</em> above the <strong>\^</strong>\'s
    in the grid. The number of <strong>\^</strong>\'s in a row must match the
    number of columns spanned by the <em>content</em> above it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="the-grid-algorithm">THE GRID ALGORITHM</h1>
<p>The grid geometry manager lays out its content in three steps. In the
first step, the minimum size needed to fit all of the content is
computed, then (if propagation is turned on), a request is made of the
container window to become that size. In the second step, the requested
size is compared against the actual size of the container. If the sizes
are different, then spaces is added to or taken away from the layout as
needed. For the final step, each content is positioned in its row(s) and
column(s) based on the setting of its <em>sticky</em> flag.</p>
<p>To compute the minimum size of a layout, the grid geometry manager first
looks at all content whose <strong>-columnspan</strong> and <strong>-rowspan</strong> values are
one, and computes the nominal size of each row or column to be either
the <em>minsize</em> for that row or column, or the sum of the <em>pad</em>ding plus
the size of the largest content, whichever is greater. After that the
rows or columns in each uniform group adapt to each other. Then the
content whose row-spans or column-spans are greater than one are
examined. If a group of rows or columns need to be increased in size in
order to accommodate these content, then extra space is added to each
row or column in the group according to its <em>weight</em>. For each group
whose weights are all zero, the additional space is apportioned equally.</p>
<p>When multiple rows or columns belong to a uniform group, the space
allocated to them is always in proportion to their weights. (A weight of
zero is considered to be 1.) In other words, a row or column configured
with <strong>-weight 1 -uniform a</strong> will have exactly the same size as any
other row or column configured with <strong>-weight 1 -uniform</strong> a. A row or
column configured with <strong>-weight 2 -uniform b</strong> will be exactly twice as
large as one that is configured with <strong>-weight 1</strong> -uniform b.</p>
<p>More technically, each row or column in the group will have a size equal
to <em>k*weight</em> for some constant <em>k</em>. The constant <em>k</em> is chosen so that
no row or column becomes smaller than its minimum size. For example, if
all rows or columns in a group have the same weight, then each row or
column will have the same size as the largest row or column in the
group.</p>
<p>For containers whose size is larger than the requested layout, the
additional space is apportioned according to the row and column weights.
If all of the weights are zero, the layout is placed within its
container according to the <em>anchor</em> value. For containers whose size is
smaller than the requested layout, space is taken away from columns and
rows according to their weights. However, once a column or row shrinks
to its minsize, its weight is taken to be zero. If more space needs to
be removed from a layout than would be permitted, as when all the rows
or columns are at their minimum sizes, the layout is placed and clipped
according to the <em>anchor</em> value.</p>
<h1 id="geometry-propagation">GEOMETRY PROPAGATION</h1>
<p>The grid geometry manager normally computes how large a container must
be to just exactly meet the needs of its content, and it sets the
requested width and height of the container to these dimensions. This
causes geometry information to propagate up through a window hierarchy
to a top-level window so that the entire sub-tree sizes itself to fit
the needs of the leaf windows. However, the <strong>grid propagate</strong> command
may be used to turn off propagation for one or more containers. If
propagation is disabled then grid will not set the requested width and
height of the container window. This may be useful if, for example, you
wish for a container window to have a fixed size that you specify.</p>
<h1 id="restrictions-on-container-windows">RESTRICTIONS ON CONTAINER WINDOWS</h1>
<p>The container for each content must either be the content\'s parent (the
default) or a descendant of the content\'s parent. This restriction is
necessary to guarantee that the content can be placed over any part of
its container that is visible without danger of the content being
clipped by its parent. In addition, all content in one call to <strong>grid</strong>
must have the same container.</p>
<h1 id="stacking-order">STACKING ORDER</h1>
<p>If the container for a content is not its parent then you must make sure
that the content is higher in the stacking order than the container.
Otherwise the container will obscure the content and it will appear as
if the content has not been managed correctly. The easiest way to make
sure the content is higher than the container is to create the container
window first: the most recently created window will be highest in the
stacking order.</p>
<h1 id="credits">CREDITS</h1>
<p>The <strong>grid</strong> command is based on ideas taken from the <em>GridBag</em> geometry
manager written by Doug. Stein, and the <strong>blt_table</strong> geometry manager,
written by George Howlett.</p>
