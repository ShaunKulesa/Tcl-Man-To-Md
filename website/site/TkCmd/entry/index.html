<p>\</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>entry</strong> command creates a new window (given by the <em>pathName</em>
argument) and makes it into an entry widget. Additional options,
described above, may be specified on the command line or in the option
database to configure aspects of the entry such as its colors, font, and
relief. The <strong>entry</strong> command returns its <em>pathName</em> argument. At the
time this command is invoked, there must not exist a window named
<em>pathName</em>, but <em>pathName</em>\'s parent must exist.</p>
<p>An entry is a widget that displays a one-line text string and allows
that string to be edited using widget commands described below, which
are typically bound to keystrokes and mouse actions. When first created,
an entry\'s string is empty. A portion of the entry may be selected as
described below. If an entry is exporting its selection (see the
<strong>-exportselection</strong> option), then it will observe the standard X11
protocols for handling the selection; entry selections are available as
type <strong>STRING</strong>. Entries also observe the standard Tk rules for dealing
with the input focus. When an entry has the input focus it displays an
<em>insertion cursor</em> to indicate where new characters will be inserted.</p>
<p>Entries are capable of displaying strings that are too long to fit
entirely within the widget\'s window. In this case, only a portion of
the string will be displayed; commands described below may be used to
change the view in the window. Entries use the standard
<strong>-xscrollcommand</strong> mechanism for interacting with scrollbars (see the
description of the <strong>-xscrollcommand</strong> option for details). They also
support scanning, as described below.</p>
<h1 id="validation">VALIDATION</h1>
<p>Validation works by setting the <strong>-validatecommand</strong> option to a script
(<em>validateCommand</em>) which will be evaluated according to the
<strong>-validate</strong> option as follows:</p>
<p>none</p>
<p>:   Default. This means no validation will occur.</p>
<p>focus</p>
<p>:   <em>validateCommand</em> will be called when the entry receives or loses
    focus.</p>
<p>focusin</p>
<p>:   <em>validateCommand</em> will be called when the entry receives focus.</p>
<p>focusout</p>
<p>:   <em>validateCommand</em> will be called when the entry loses focus.</p>
<p>key</p>
<p>:   <em>validateCommand</em> will be called when the entry is edited.</p>
<p>all</p>
<p>:   <em>validateCommand</em> will be called for all above conditions.</p>
<p>It is possible to perform percent substitutions on the value of the
<strong>-validatecommand</strong> and <strong>-invalidcommand</strong> options, just as you would
in a <strong>bind</strong> script. The following substitutions are recognized:</p>
<p>%d</p>
<p>:   Type of action: 1 for <strong>insert</strong>, 0 for <strong>delete</strong>, or -1 for focus,
    forced or textvariable validation.</p>
<p>%i</p>
<p>:   Index of char string to be inserted/deleted, if any, otherwise -1.</p>
<p>%P</p>
<p>:   The value of the entry if the edit is allowed. If you are
    configuring the entry widget to have a new textvariable, this will
    be the value of that textvariable.</p>
<p>%s</p>
<p>:   The current value of entry prior to editing.</p>
<p>%S</p>
<p>:   The text string being inserted/deleted, if any, {} otherwise.</p>
<p>%v</p>
<p>:   The type of validation currently set.</p>
<p>%V</p>
<p>:   The type of validation that triggered the callback (key, focusin,
    focusout, forced).</p>
<p>%W</p>
<p>:   The name of the entry widget.</p>
<p>In general, the <strong>-textvariable</strong> and <strong>-validatecommand</strong> options can
be dangerous to mix. Any problems have been overcome so that using the
<strong>-validatecommand</strong> will not interfere with the traditional behavior of
the entry widget. Using the <strong>-textvariable</strong> for read-only purposes
will never cause problems. The danger comes when you try set the
<strong>-textvariable</strong> to something that the <strong>-validatecommand</strong> would not
accept, which causes <strong>-validate</strong> to become <em>none</em> (the
<strong>-invalidcommand</strong> will not be triggered). The same happens when an
error occurs evaluating the <strong>-validatecommand</strong>.</p>
<p>Primarily, an error will occur when the <strong>-validatecommand</strong> or
<strong>-invalidcommand</strong> encounters an error in its script while evaluating
or <strong>-validatecommand</strong> does not return a valid Tcl boolean value. The
<strong>-validate</strong> option will also set itself to <strong>none</strong> when you edit the
entry widget from within either the <strong>-validatecommand</strong> or the
<strong>-invalidcommand</strong>. Such editions will override the one that was being
validated. If you wish to edit the entry widget (for example set it to
{}) during validation and still have the <strong>-validate</strong> option set, you
should include the command</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>after idle {%W config -validate %v}
</code></pre></div>
<p>in the <strong>-validatecommand</strong> or <strong>-invalidcommand</strong> (whichever one you
were editing the entry widget from). It is also recommended to not set
an associated <strong>-textvariable</strong> during validation, as that can cause the
entry widget to become out of sync with the <strong>-textvariable</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="widget-command">WIDGET COMMAND</h1>
<p>The <strong>entry</strong> command creates a new Tcl command whose name is
<em>pathName</em>. This command may be used to invoke various operations on the
widget. It has the following general form:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>pathName subcommand ?arg arg ...?
</code></pre></div>
<p><em>Subcommand</em> and the <em>arg</em>s determine the exact behavior of the command.</p>
<h2 id="indices">INDICES</h2>
<p>Many of the widget commands for entries take one or more indices as
arguments. An index specifies a particular character in the entry\'s
string, in any of the following ways:</p>
<p><em>number</em></p>
<p>:   Specifies the character as a numerical index, where 0 corresponds to
    the first character in the string.</p>
<p><strong>anchor</strong></p>
<p>:   Indicates the anchor point for the selection, which is set with the
    <strong>select from</strong> and <strong>select adjust</strong> widget commands.</p>
<p><strong>end</strong></p>
<p>:   Indicates the character just after the last one in the entry\'s
    string. This is equivalent to specifying a numerical index equal to
    the length of the entry\'s string.</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong></p>
<p>:   Indicates the character adjacent to and immediately following the
    insertion cursor.</p>
<p><strong>sel.first</strong></p>
<p>:   Indicates the first character in the selection. It is an error to
    use this form if the selection is not in the entry window.</p>
<p><strong>sel.last</strong></p>
<p>:   Indicates the character just after the last one in the selection. It
    is an error to use this form if the selection is not in the entry
    window.</p>
<p><strong>@</strong><em>number</em></p>
<p>:   In this form, <em>number</em> is treated as an x-coordinate in the entry\'s
    window; the character spanning that x-coordinate is used. For
    example, indicates the left-most character in the window.</p>
<p>Abbreviations may be used for any of the forms above, e.g. or In
general, out-of-range indices are automatically rounded to the nearest
legal value.</p>
<h2 id="subcommands">SUBCOMMANDS</h2>
<p>The following commands are possible for entry widgets:</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>bbox </strong><em>index</em></p>
<p>:   Returns a list of four numbers describing the bounding box of the
    character given by <em>index</em>. The first two elements of the list give
    the x and y coordinates of the upper-left corner of the screen area
    covered by the character (in pixels relative to the widget) and the
    last two elements give the width and height of the character, in
    pixels. The bounding box may refer to a region outside the visible
    area of the window.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>cget</strong> <em>option</em></p>
<p>:   Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
    <em>option</em>. <em>Option</em> may have any of the values accepted by the
    <strong>entry</strong> command.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>configure</strong> ?<em>option</em>? ?<em>value option value ...</em>?</p>
<p>:   Query or modify the configuration options of the widget. If no
    <em>option</em> is specified, returns a list describing all of the
    available options for <em>pathName</em> (see <strong>Tk_ConfigureInfo</strong> for
    information on the format of this list). If <em>option</em> is specified
    with no <em>value</em>, then the command returns a list describing the one
    named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
    sublist of the value returned if no <em>option</em> is specified). If one
    or more <em>option-value</em> pairs are specified, then the command
    modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s); in
    this case the command returns an empty string. <em>Option</em> may have any
    of the values accepted by the <strong>entry</strong> command.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>delete </strong><em>first </em>?<em>last</em>?</p>
<p>:   Delete one or more elements of the entry. <em>First</em> is the index of
    the first character to delete, and <em>last</em> is the index of the
    character just after the last one to delete. If <em>last</em> is not
    specified it defaults to <em>first</em>+1, i.e. a single character is
    deleted. This command returns an empty string.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>get</strong></p>
<p>:   Returns the entry\'s string.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>icursor </strong><em>index</em></p>
<p>:   Arrange for the insertion cursor to be displayed just before the
    character given by <em>index</em>. Returns an empty string.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>index</strong><em> index</em></p>
<p>:   Returns the numerical index corresponding to <em>index</em>.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>insert </strong><em>index string</em></p>
<p>:   Insert the characters of <em>string</em> just before the character
    indicated by <em>index</em>. Returns an empty string.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>scan</strong> <em>option args</em></p>
<p>:   This command is used to implement scanning on entries. It has two
    forms, depending on <em>option</em>:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>*pathName ***scan mark ***x*

:   Records *x* and the current view in the entry window; used in
    conjunction with later **scan dragto** commands. Typically this
    command is associated with a mouse button press in the widget.
    It returns an empty string.

*pathName ***scan dragto ***x*

:   This command computes the difference between its *x* argument
    and the *x* argument to the last **scan mark** command for the
    widget. It then adjusts the view left or right by 10 times the
    difference in x-coordinates. This command is typically
    associated with mouse motion events in the widget, to produce
    the effect of dragging the entry at high speed through the
    window. The return value is an empty string.
</code></pre></div>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>selection </strong><em>option arg</em></p>
<p>:   This command is used to adjust the selection within an entry. It has
    several forms, depending on <em>option</em>:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>*pathName ***selection adjust ***index*

:   Locate the end of the selection nearest to the character given
    by *index*, and adjust that end of the selection to be at
    *index* (i.e. including but not going beyond *index*). The other
    end of the selection is made the anchor point for future
    **select to** commands. If the selection is not currently in the
    entry, then a new selection is created to include the characters
    between *index* and the most recent selection anchor point,
    inclusive. Returns an empty string.

*pathName ***selection clear**

:   Clear the selection if it is currently in this widget. If the
    selection is not in this widget then the command has no effect.
    Returns an empty string.

*pathName ***selection from ***index*

:   Set the selection anchor point to just before the character
    given by *index*. Does not change the selection. Returns an
    empty string.

*pathName ***selection present**

:   Returns 1 if there is are characters selected in the entry, 0 if
    nothing is selected.

*pathName ***selection range ***start* *end*

:   Sets the selection to include the characters starting with the
    one indexed by *start* and ending with the one just before
    *end*. If *end* refers to the same character as *start* or an
    earlier one, then the entry\&#39;s selection is cleared.

*pathName ***selection to ***index*

:   If *index* is before the anchor point, set the selection to the
    characters from *index* up to but not including the anchor
    point. If *index* is the same as the anchor point, do nothing.
    If *index* is after the anchor point, set the selection to the
    characters from the anchor point up to but not including
    *index*. The anchor point is determined by the most recent
    **select from** or **select adjust** command in this widget. If
    the selection is not in this widget then a new selection is
    created using the most recent anchor point specified for the
    widget. Returns an empty string.
</code></pre></div>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>validate</strong></p>
<p>:   This command is used to force an evaluation of the
    <strong>-validatecommand</strong> independent of the conditions specified by the
    <strong>-validate</strong> option. This is done by temporarily setting the
    <strong>-validate</strong> option to <strong>all</strong>. It returns 0 or 1.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>xview </strong><em>args</em></p>
<p>:   This command is used to query and change the horizontal position of
    the text in the widget\'s window. It can take any of the following
    forms:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>*pathName ***xview**

:   Returns a list containing two elements. Each element is a real
    fraction between 0 and 1; together they describe the horizontal
    span that is visible in the window. For example, if the first
    element is .2 and the second element is .6, 20% of the entry\&#39;s
    text is off-screen to the left, the middle 40% is visible in the
    window, and 40% of the text is off-screen to the right. These
    are the same values passed to scrollbars via the
    **-xscrollcommand** option.

*pathName ***xview** *index*

:   Adjusts the view in the window so that the character given by
    *index* is displayed at the left edge of the window.

*pathName ***xview moveto*** fraction*

:   Adjusts the view in the window so that the character *fraction*
    of the way through the text appears at the left edge of the
    window. *Fraction* must be a fraction between 0 and 1.

*pathName ***xview scroll ***number what*

:   This command shifts the view in the window left or right
    according to *number* and *what*. *Number* must be an integer.
    *What* must be either **units** or **pages** or an abbreviation
    of one of these. If *what* is **units**, the view adjusts left
    or right by *number* average-width characters on the display; if
    it is **pages** then the view adjusts by *number* screenfuls. If
    *number* is negative then characters farther to the left become
    visible; if it is positive then characters farther to the right
    become visible.
</code></pre></div>
<h1 id="default-bindings">DEFAULT BINDINGS</h1>
<p>Tk automatically creates class bindings for entries that give them the
following default behavior. In the descriptions below, refers to a
contiguous group of letters, digits, or characters, or any single
character other than these.</p>
<p>[1]</p>
<p>:   Clicking mouse button 1 positions the insertion cursor just before
    the character underneath the mouse cursor, sets the input focus to
    this widget, and clears any selection in the widget. Dragging with
    mouse button 1 strokes out a selection between the insertion cursor
    and the character under the mouse.</p>
<p>[2]</p>
<p>:   Double-clicking with mouse button 1 selects the word under the mouse
    and positions the insertion cursor at the end of the word. Dragging
    after a double click will stroke out a selection consisting of whole
    words.</p>
<p>[3]</p>
<p>:   Triple-clicking with mouse button 1 selects all of the text in the
    entry and positions the insertion cursor at the end of the line.</p>
<p>[4]</p>
<p>:   The ends of the selection can be adjusted by dragging with mouse
    button 1 while the Shift key is down; this will adjust the end of
    the selection that was nearest to the mouse cursor when button 1 was
    pressed. If the button is double-clicked before dragging then the
    selection will be adjusted in units of whole words.</p>
<p>[5]</p>
<p>:   Clicking mouse button 1 with the Control key down will position the
    insertion cursor in the entry without affecting the selection.</p>
<p>[6]</p>
<p>:   If any normal printing characters are typed in an entry, they are
    inserted at the point of the insertion cursor.</p>
<p>[7]</p>
<p>:   The view in the entry can be adjusted by dragging with the middle
    mouse button (button 2, or button 3 in TkAqua). If the middle mouse
    button is clicked without moving the mouse, the selection is copied
    into the entry at the position of the mouse cursor.</p>
<p>[8]</p>
<p>:   If the mouse is dragged out of the entry on the left or right sides
    while button 1 is pressed, the entry will automatically scroll to
    make more text visible (if there is more text off-screen on the side
    where the mouse left the window).</p>
<p>[9]</p>
<p>:   The Left and Right keys move the insertion cursor one character to
    the left or right; they also clear any selection in the entry and
    set the selection anchor. If Left or Right is typed with the Shift
    key down, then the insertion cursor moves and the selection is
    extended to include the new character. Control-Left and
    Control-Right move the insertion cursor by words, and
    Control-Shift-Left and Control-Shift-Right move the insertion cursor
    by words and also extend the selection. Control-b and Control-f
    behave the same as Left and Right, respectively. Meta-b and Meta-f
    behave the same as Control-Left and Control-Right, respectively.</p>
<p>[10]</p>
<p>:   The Home key, or Control-a, will move the insertion cursor to the
    beginning of the entry and clear any selection in the entry.
    Shift-Home moves the insertion cursor to the beginning of the entry
    and also extends the selection to that point.</p>
<p>[11]</p>
<p>:   The End key, or Control-e, will move the insertion cursor to the end
    of the entry and clear any selection in the entry. Shift-End moves
    the cursor to the end and extends the selection to that point.</p>
<p>[12]</p>
<p>:   The Select key and Control-Space set the selection anchor to the
    position of the insertion cursor. They do not affect the current
    selection. Shift-Select and Control-Shift-Space adjust the selection
    to the current position of the insertion cursor, selecting from the
    anchor to the insertion cursor if there was not any selection
    previously.</p>
<p>[13]</p>
<p>:   Control-/ selects all the text in the entry.</p>
<p>[14]</p>
<p>:   Control-\ clears any selection in the entry.</p>
<p>[15]</p>
<p>:   The F16 key (labelled Copy on many Sun workstations) or Meta-w
    copies the selection in the widget to the clipboard, if there is a
    selection.</p>
<p>[16]</p>
<p>:   The F20 key (labelled Cut on many Sun workstations) or Control-w
    copies the selection in the widget to the clipboard and deletes the
    selection. If there is no selection in the widget then these keys
    have no effect.</p>
<p>[17]</p>
<p>:   The F18 key (labelled Paste on many Sun workstations) or Control-y
    inserts the contents of the clipboard at the position of the
    insertion cursor.</p>
<p>[18]</p>
<p>:   The Delete key deletes the selection, if there is one in the entry.
    If there is no selection, it deletes the character to the right of
    the insertion cursor.</p>
<p>[19]</p>
<p>:   The BackSpace key and Control-h delete the selection, if there is
    one in the entry. If there is no selection, it deletes the character
    to the left of the insertion cursor.</p>
<p>[20]</p>
<p>:   Control-d deletes the character to the right of the insertion
    cursor.</p>
<p>[21]</p>
<p>:   Meta-d deletes the word to the right of the insertion cursor.</p>
<p>[22]</p>
<p>:   Control-k deletes all the characters to the right of the insertion
    cursor.</p>
<p>[23]</p>
<p>:   Control-t reverses the order of the two characters to the right of
    the insertion cursor.</p>
<p>If the entry is disabled using the <strong>-state</strong> option, then the entry\'s
view can still be adjusted and text in the entry can still be selected,
but no insertion cursor will be displayed and no text modifications will
take place except if the entry is linked to a variable using the
<strong>-textvariable</strong> option, in which case any changes to the variable are
reflected by the entry whatever the value of its <strong>-state</strong> option.</p>
<p>The behavior of entries can be changed by defining new bindings for
individual widgets or by redefining the class bindings.</p>
