<h1 id="name">NAME</h1>
<p>bind - Arrange for X events to invoke Tcl scripts</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>bind</strong><em> tag</em> ?<em>sequence</em>? ?<strong>+</strong>??<em>script</em>?</p>
<p>\</p>
<h1 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>bind</strong> command associates Tcl scripts with X events. If all three
arguments are specified, <strong>bind</strong> will arrange for <em>script</em> (a Tcl
script called the to be evaluated whenever the event(s) given by
<em>sequence</em> occur in the window(s) identified by <em>tag</em>. If <em>script</em> is
prefixed with a then it is appended to any existing binding for
<em>sequence</em>; otherwise <em>script</em> replaces any existing binding. If
<em>script</em> is an empty string then the current binding for <em>sequence</em> is
destroyed, leaving <em>sequence</em> unbound. In all of the cases where a
<em>script</em> argument is provided, <strong>bind</strong> returns an empty string.</p>
<p>If <em>sequence</em> is specified without a <em>script</em>, then the script currently
bound to <em>sequence</em> is returned, or an empty string is returned if there
is no binding for <em>sequence</em>. If neither <em>sequence</em> nor <em>script</em> is
specified, then the return value is a list whose elements are all the
sequences for which there exist bindings for <em>tag</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>tag</em> argument determines which window(s) the binding applies to. If
<em>tag</em> begins with a dot, as in <strong>.a.b.c</strong>, then it must be the path name
for a window; otherwise it may be an arbitrary string. Each window has
an associated list of tags, and a binding applies to a particular window
if its tag is among those specified for the window. Although the
<strong>bindtags</strong> command may be used to assign an arbitrary set of binding
tags to a window, the default binding tags provide the following
behavior:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If a tag is the name of an internal window the binding applies to
    that window.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the tag is the name of a class of widgets, such as <strong>Button</strong>,
    the binding applies to all widgets in that class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the tag is the name of a toplevel window the binding applies to
    the toplevel window and all its internal windows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If <em>tag</em> has the value <strong>all</strong>, the binding applies to all windows
    in the application.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="event-patterns">EVENT PATTERNS</h1>
<p>The <em>sequence</em> argument specifies a sequence of one or more event
patterns, with optional white space between the patterns. Each event
pattern may take one of three forms. In the simplest case it is a single
printing ASCII character, such as <strong>a</strong> or <strong>[</strong>. The character may not
be a space character or the character <strong>\&lt;</strong>. This form of pattern
matches a <strong>KeyPress</strong> event for the particular character. The second
form of pattern is longer but more general. It has the following syntax:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>&lt;modifier-modifier-type-detail&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p>The entire event pattern is surrounded by angle brackets. Inside the
angle brackets are zero or more modifiers, an event type, and an extra
piece of information (<em>detail</em>) identifying a particular button or
keysym. Any of the fields may be omitted, as long as at least one of
<em>type</em> and <em>detail</em> is present. The fields must be separated by white
space or dashes.</p>
<p>The third form of pattern is used to specify a user-defined, named
virtual event. It has the following syntax:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>&lt;&lt;name&gt;&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p>The entire virtual event pattern is surrounded by double angle brackets.
Inside the angle brackets is the user-defined name of the virtual event.
Modifiers, such as <strong>Shift</strong> or <strong>Control</strong>, may not be combined with a
virtual event to modify it. Bindings on a virtual event may be created
before the virtual event is defined, and if the definition of a virtual
event changes dynamically, all windows bound to that virtual event will
respond immediately to the new definition.</p>
<p>Some widgets (e.g. <strong>menu</strong> and <strong>text</strong>) issue virtual events when
their internal state is updated in some ways. Please see the manual page
for each widget for details.</p>
<h2 id="modifiers">MODIFIERS</h2>
<p>Modifiers consist of any of the following values:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Control   Mod1, M1, Command
Alt   Mod2, M2, Option
Shift Mod3, M3
Lock  Mod4, M4
Extended  Mod5, M5
Button1, B1   Meta, M
Button2, B2   Double
Button3, B3   Triple
Button4, B4   Quadruple
Button5, B5
</code></pre></div>
</blockquote>
<p>Where more than one value is listed, separated by commas, the values are
equivalent. Most of the modifiers have the obvious X meanings. For
example, <strong>Button1</strong> requires that button 1 be depressed when the event
occurs. For a binding to match a given event, the modifiers in the event
must include all of those specified in the event pattern. An event may
also contain additional modifiers not specified in the binding. For
example, if button 1 is pressed while the shift and control keys are
down, the pattern <strong>\&lt;Control-Button-1></strong> will match the event, but
<strong>\&lt;Mod1-Button-1></strong> will not. If no modifiers are specified, then any
combination of modifiers may be present in the event.</p>
<p><strong>Meta</strong> and <strong>M</strong> refer to whichever of the <strong>M1</strong> through <strong>M5</strong>
modifiers is associated with the Meta key(s) on the keyboard (keysyms
<strong>Meta_R</strong> and <strong>Meta_L</strong>). If there are no Meta keys, or if they are
not associated with any modifiers, then <strong>Meta</strong> and <strong>M</strong> will not
match any events. Similarly, the <strong>Alt</strong> modifier refers to whichever
modifier is associated with the alt key(s) on the keyboard (keysyms
<strong>Alt_L</strong> and <strong>Alt_R</strong>).</p>
<p>The <strong>Double</strong>, <strong>Triple</strong> and <strong>Quadruple</strong> modifiers are a convenience
for specifying double mouse clicks and other repeated events. They cause
a particular event pattern to be repeated 2, 3 or 4 times, and also
place a time and space requirement on the sequence: for a sequence of
events to match a <strong>Double</strong>, <strong>Triple</strong> or <strong>Quadruple</strong> pattern, all
of the events must occur close together in time and without substantial
mouse motion in between. For example, <strong>\&lt;Double-Button-1></strong> is
equivalent to <strong>\&lt;Button-1>\&lt;Button-1></strong> with the extra time and space
requirement.</p>
<p>The <strong>Command</strong> and <strong>Option</strong> modifiers are equivalents of <strong>Mod1</strong>
resp. <strong>Mod2</strong>, they correspond to Macintosh-specific modifier keys.</p>
<p>The <strong>Extended</strong> modifier is, at present, specific to Windows. It
appears on events that are associated with the keys on the On a US
keyboard, the extended keys include the <strong>Alt</strong> and <strong>Control</strong> keys at
the right of the keyboard, the cursor keys in the cluster to the left of
the numeric pad, the <strong>NumLock</strong> key, the <strong>Break</strong> key, the
<strong>PrintScreen</strong> key, and the <strong>/</strong> and <strong>Enter</strong> keys in the numeric
keypad.</p>
<h2 id="event-types">EVENT TYPES</h2>
<p>The <em>type</em> field may be any of the standard X event types, with a few
extra abbreviations. The <em>type</em> field will also accept a couple
non-standard X event types that were added to better support the
Macintosh and Windows platforms. Below is a list of all the valid types;
where two names appear together, they are synonyms.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Activate  Destroy Map
ButtonPress, Button   Enter   MapRequest
ButtonRelease Expose  Motion
Circulate FocusIn MouseWheel
CirculateRequest  FocusOut    Property
Colormap  Gravity Reparent
Configure KeyPress, Key   ResizeRequest
ConfigureRequest  KeyRelease  Unmap
Create    Leave   Visibility
Deactivate
</code></pre></div>
</blockquote>
<p>Most of the above events have the same fields and behaviors as events in
the X Windowing system. You can find more detailed descriptions of these
events in any X window programming book. A couple of the events are
extensions to the X event system to support features unique to the
Macintosh and Windows platforms. We provide a little more detail on
these events here. These include:</p>
<p>Activate, Deactivate</p>
<p>:   These two events are sent to every sub-window of a toplevel when
    they change state. In addition to the focus Window, the Macintosh
    platform and Windows platforms have a notion of an active window
    (which often has but is not required to have the focus). On the
    Macintosh, widgets in the active window have a different appearance
    than widgets in deactive windows. The <strong>Activate</strong> event is sent to
    all the sub-windows in a toplevel when it changes from being
    deactive to active. Likewise, the <strong>Deactive</strong> event is sent when
    the window\'s state changes from active to deactive. There are no
    useful percent substitutions you would make when binding to these
    events.</p>
<p>MouseWheel</p>
<p>:   Many contemporary mice support a mouse wheel, which is used for
    scrolling documents without using the scrollbars. By rolling the
    wheel, the system will generate <strong>MouseWheel</strong> events that the
    application can use to scroll. The event is routed to the window
    currently under the mouse pointer. When the event is received you
    can use the <strong>%D</strong> substitution to get the <em>delta</em> field for the
    event, which is an integer value describing how the mouse wheel has
    moved. The smallest value for which the system will report is
    defined by the OS. The sign of the value determines which direction
    your widget should scroll. Positive values should scroll up and
    negative values should scroll down.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Horizontal scrolling uses **Shift-MouseWheel** events, with positive
**%D** *delta* substitution indicating left scrolling and negative
right scrolling. Only Windows and macOS Aqua typically fire
**MouseWheel** and **Shift-MouseWheel** events. On X11 vertical
scrolling is rather supported through **Button-4** and **Button-5**
events, and horizontal scrolling through **Shift-Button-4** and
**Shift-Button-5** events. Horizontal scrolling events may fire from
many different hardware units such as tilt wheels or touchpads.
Horizontal scrolling can also be emulated by holding Shift and
scrolling vertically.
</code></pre></div>
<p>KeyPress, KeyRelease</p>
<p>:   The <strong>KeyPress</strong> and <strong>KeyRelease</strong> events are generated whenever a
    key is pressed or released. <strong>KeyPress</strong> and <strong>KeyRelease</strong> events
    are sent to the window which currently has the keyboard focus.</p>
<p>ButtonPress, ButtonRelease, Motion</p>
<p>:   The <strong>ButtonPress</strong> and <strong>ButtonRelease</strong> events are generated when
    the user presses or releases a mouse button. <strong>Motion</strong> events are
    generated whenever the pointer is moved. <strong>ButtonPress</strong>,
    <strong>ButtonRelease</strong>, and <strong>Motion</strong> events are normally sent to the
    window containing the pointer.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>When a mouse button is pressed, the window containing the pointer
automatically obtains a temporary pointer grab. Subsequent
**ButtonPress**, **ButtonRelease**, and **Motion** events will be
sent to that window, regardless of which window contains the
pointer, until all buttons have been released.
</code></pre></div>
<p>Configure</p>
<p>:   A <strong>Configure</strong> event is sent to a window whenever its size,
    position, or border width changes, and sometimes when it has changed
    position in the stacking order.</p>
<p>Map, Unmap</p>
<p>:   The <strong>Map</strong> and <strong>Unmap</strong> events are generated whenever the mapping
    state of a window changes.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Windows are created in the unmapped state. Top-level windows become
mapped when they transition to the **normal** state, and are
unmapped in the **withdrawn** and **iconic** states. Other windows
become mapped when they are placed under control of a geometry
manager (for example **pack** or **grid**).

A window is *viewable* only if it and all of its ancestors are
mapped. Note that geometry managers typically do not map their
children until they have been mapped themselves, and unmap all
children when they become unmapped; hence in Tk **Map** and
**Unmap** events indicate whether or not a window is viewable.
</code></pre></div>
<p>Visibility</p>
<p>:   A window is said to be <em>obscured</em> when another window above it in
    the stacking order fully or partially overlaps it. <strong>Visibility</strong>
    events are generated whenever a window\'s obscurity state changes;
    the <em>state</em> field (<strong>%s</strong>) specifies the new state.</p>
<p>Expose</p>
<p>:   An <strong>Expose</strong> event is generated whenever all or part of a window
    should be redrawn (for example, when a window is first mapped or if
    it becomes unobscured). It is normally not necessary for client
    applications to handle <strong>Expose</strong> events, since Tk handles them
    internally.</p>
<p>Destroy</p>
<p>:   A <strong>Destroy</strong> event is delivered to a window when it is destroyed.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>When the **Destroy** event is delivered to a widget, it is in a
state: the widget still exists, but operations that involve it may
return invalid results, or return an error.
</code></pre></div>
<p>FocusIn, FocusOut</p>
<p>:   The <strong>FocusIn</strong> and <strong>FocusOut</strong> events are generated whenever the
    keyboard focus changes. A <strong>FocusOut</strong> event is sent to the old
    focus window, and a <strong>FocusIn</strong> event is sent to the new one.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>In addition, if the old and new focus windows do not share a common
parent, focus events are sent to the intermediate windows in the
hierarchy. Thus a **FocusIn** event indicates that the target window
or one of its descendants has acquired the focus, and a **FocusOut**
event indicates that the focus has been changed to a window outside
the target window\&#39;s hierarchy.

The keyboard focus may be changed explicitly by a call to **focus**,
or implicitly by the window manager.
</code></pre></div>
<p>Enter, Leave</p>
<p>:   An <strong>Enter</strong> event is sent to a window when the pointer enters that
    window, and a <strong>Leave</strong> event is sent when the pointer leaves it.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>If there is a pointer grab in effect, **Enter** and **Leave** events
are only delivered to the window owning the grab.

In addition, when the pointer moves between two windows, **Enter**
and **Leave** events are sent to intermediate windows in the
hierarchy in the same manner as for **FocusIn** and **FocusOut**
events.
</code></pre></div>
<p>Property</p>
<p>:   A <strong>Property</strong> event is sent to a window whenever an X property
    belonging to that window is changed or deleted. <strong>Property</strong> events
    are not normally delivered to Tk applications as they are handled by
    the Tk core.</p>
<p>Colormap</p>
<p>:   A <strong>Colormap</strong> event is generated whenever the colormap associated
    with a window has been changed, installed, or uninstalled.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Widgets may be assigned a private colormap by specifying a
**-colormap** option; the window manager is responsible for
installing and uninstalling colormaps as necessary.

Note that Tk provides no useful details for this event type.
</code></pre></div>
<p>MapRequest, CirculateRequest, ResizeRequest, ConfigureRequest, Create</p>
<p>:   These events are not normally delivered to Tk applications. They are
    included for completeness, to make it possible to write X11 window
    managers in Tk. (These events are only delivered when a client has
    selected <strong>SubstructureRedirectMask</strong> on a window; the Tk core does
    not use this mask.)</p>
<p>Gravity, Reparent, Circulate</p>
<p>:   The events <strong>Gravity</strong> and <strong>Reparent</strong> are not normally delivered
    to Tk applications. They are included for completeness.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>A **Circulate** event indicates that the window has moved to the top
or to the bottom of the stacking order as a result of an
**XCirculateSubwindows** protocol request. Note that the stacking
order may be changed for other reasons which do not generate a
**Circulate** event, and that Tk does not use
**XCirculateSubwindows()** internally. This event type is included
only for completeness; there is no reliable way to track changes to
a window\&#39;s position in the stacking order.
</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="event-details">EVENT DETAILS</h2>
<p>The last part of a long event specification is <em>detail</em>. In the case of
a <strong>ButtonPress</strong> or <strong>ButtonRelease</strong> event, it is the number of a
button (1-5). If a button number is given, then only an event on that
particular button will match; if no button number is given, then an
event on any button will match. Note: giving a specific button number is
different than specifying a button modifier; in the first case, it
refers to a button being pressed or released, while in the second it
refers to some other button that is already depressed when the matching
event occurs. If a button number is given then <em>type</em> may be omitted: if
will default to <strong>ButtonPress</strong>. For example, the specifier <strong>\&lt;1></strong> is
equivalent to <strong>\&lt;ButtonPress-1></strong>.</p>
<p>If the event type is <strong>KeyPress</strong> or <strong>KeyRelease</strong>, then <em>detail</em> may
be specified in the form of an X keysym. Keysyms are textual
specifications for particular keys on the keyboard; they include all the
alphanumeric ASCII characters (e.g. is the keysym for the ASCII
character plus descriptions for non-alphanumeric characters plus
descriptions for all the non-ASCII keys on the keyboard (e.g. is the
keysym for the left shift key, and is the keysym for the F1 function
key, if it exists). The complete list of keysyms is not presented here;
it is available in other X documentation and may vary from system to
system. If necessary, you can use the <strong>%K</strong> notation described below to
print out the keysym name for a particular key. If a keysym <em>detail</em> is
given, then the <em>type</em> field may be omitted; it will default to
<strong>KeyPress</strong>. For example, <strong>\&lt;Control-comma></strong> is equivalent to
<strong>\&lt;Control-KeyPress-comma></strong>.</p>
<h1 id="binding-scripts-and-substitutions">BINDING SCRIPTS AND SUBSTITUTIONS</h1>
<p>The <em>script</em> argument to <strong>bind</strong> is a Tcl script, called the which will
be executed whenever the given event sequence occurs. <em>Command</em> will be
executed in the same interpreter that the <strong>bind</strong> command was executed
in, and it will run at global level (only global variables will be
accessible). If <em>script</em> contains any <strong>%</strong> characters, then the script
will not be executed directly. Instead, a new script will be generated
by replacing each <strong>%</strong>, and the character following it, with
information from the current event. The replacement depends on the
character following the <strong>%</strong>, as defined in the list below. Unless
otherwise indicated, the replacement string is the decimal value of the
given field from the current event. Some of the substitutions are only
valid for certain types of events; if they are used for other types of
events the value substituted is undefined.</p>
<p>%%</p>
<p>:   Replaced with a single percent.</p>
<p>%#</p>
<p>:   The number of the last client request processed by the server (the
    <em>serial</em> field from the event). Valid for all event types.</p>
<p>%a</p>
<p>:   The <em>above</em> field from the event, formatted as a hexadecimal number.
    Valid only for <strong>Configure</strong> events. Indicates the sibling window
    immediately below the receiving window in the stacking order, or
    <strong>0</strong> if the receiving window is at the bottom.</p>
<p>%b</p>
<p>:   The number of the button that was pressed or released. Valid only
    for <strong>ButtonPress</strong> and <strong>ButtonRelease</strong> events.</p>
<p>%c</p>
<p>:   The <em>count</em> field from the event. Valid only for <strong>Expose</strong> events.
    Indicates that there are <em>count</em> pending <strong>Expose</strong> events which
    have not yet been delivered to the window.</p>
<p>%d</p>
<p>:   The <em>detail</em> or <em>user_data</em> field from the event. The <strong>%d</strong> is
    replaced by a string identifying the detail. For <strong>Enter</strong>,
    <strong>Leave</strong>, <strong>FocusIn</strong>, and <strong>FocusOut</strong> events, the string will be
    one of the following:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>&gt;
&gt;     NotifyAncestor    NotifyNonlinearVirtual
&gt;     NotifyDetailNone  NotifyPointer
&gt;     NotifyInferior    NotifyPointerRoot
&gt;     NotifyNonlinear   NotifyVirtual

For **ConfigureRequest** events, the string will be one of:

&gt;
&gt;     Above Opposite
&gt;     Below None
&gt;     BottomIf  TopIf

For virtual events, the string will be whatever value is stored in
the *user_data* field when the event was created (typically with
**event generate**), or the empty string if the field is NULL.
Virtual events corresponding to key sequence presses (see **event**
add for details) set the *user_data* to NULL. For events other than
these, the substituted string is undefined.
</code></pre></div>
<p>%f</p>
<p>:   The <em>focus</em> field from the event (<strong>0</strong> or <strong>1</strong>). Valid only for
    <strong>Enter</strong> and <strong>Leave</strong> events. <strong>1</strong> if the receiving window is the
    focus window or a descendant of the focus window, <strong>0</strong> otherwise.</p>
<p>%h</p>
<p>:   The <em>height</em> field from the event. Valid for the <strong>Configure</strong>,
    <strong>ConfigureRequest</strong>, <strong>Create</strong>, <strong>ResizeRequest</strong>, and <strong>Expose</strong>
    events. Indicates the new or requested height of the window.</p>
<p>%i</p>
<p>:   The <em>window</em> field from the event, represented as a hexadecimal
    integer. Valid for all event types.</p>
<p>%k</p>
<p>:   The <em>keycode</em> field from the event. Valid only for <strong>KeyPress</strong> and
    <strong>KeyRelease</strong> events.</p>
<p>%m</p>
<p>:   The <em>mode</em> field from the event. The substituted string is one of
    <strong>NotifyNormal</strong>, <strong>NotifyGrab</strong>, <strong>NotifyUngrab</strong>, or
    <strong>NotifyWhileGrabbed</strong>. Valid only for <strong>Enter</strong>, <strong>FocusIn</strong>,
    <strong>FocusOut</strong>, and <strong>Leave</strong> events.</p>
<p>%o</p>
<p>:   The <em>override_redirect</em> field from the event. Valid only for
    <strong>Map</strong>, <strong>Reparent</strong>, and <strong>Configure</strong> events.</p>
<p>%p</p>
<p>:   The <em>place</em> field from the event, substituted as one of the strings
    <strong>PlaceOnTop</strong> or <strong>PlaceOnBottom</strong>. Valid only for <strong>Circulate</strong>
    and <strong>CirculateRequest</strong> events.</p>
<p>%s</p>
<p>:   The <em>state</em> field from the event. For <strong>ButtonPress</strong>,
    <strong>ButtonRelease</strong>, <strong>Enter</strong>, <strong>KeyPress</strong>, <strong>KeyRelease</strong>,
    <strong>Leave</strong>, and <strong>Motion</strong> events, a decimal string is substituted.
    For <strong>Visibility</strong>, one of the strings <strong>VisibilityUnobscured</strong>,
    <strong>VisibilityPartiallyObscured</strong>, and <strong>VisibilityFullyObscured</strong> is
    substituted. For <strong>Property</strong> events, substituted with either the
    string <strong>NewValue</strong> (indicating that the property has been created
    or modified) or <strong>Delete</strong> (indicating that the property has been
    removed).</p>
<p>%t</p>
<p>:   The <em>time</em> field from the event. This is the X server timestamp
    (typically the time since the last server reset) in milliseconds,
    when the event occurred. Valid for most events.</p>
<p>%w</p>
<p>:   The <em>width</em> field from the event. Indicates the new or requested
    width of the window. Valid only for <strong>Configure</strong>,
    <strong>ConfigureRequest</strong>, <strong>Create</strong>, <strong>ResizeRequest</strong>, and <strong>Expose</strong>
    events.</p>
<p>%x, %y</p>
<p>:   The <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> fields from the event. For <strong>ButtonPress</strong>,
    <strong>ButtonRelease</strong>, <strong>Motion</strong>, <strong>KeyPress</strong>, <strong>KeyRelease</strong>, and
    <strong>MouseWheel</strong> events, <strong>%x</strong> and <strong>%y</strong> indicate the position of
    the mouse pointer relative to the receiving window. For key events
    on the Macintosh these are the coordinates of the mouse at the
    moment when an X11 KeyEvent is sent to Tk, which could be slightly
    later than the time of the physical press or release. For <strong>Enter</strong>
    and <strong>Leave</strong> events, the position where the mouse pointer crossed
    the window, relative to the receiving window. For <strong>Configure</strong> and
    <strong>Create</strong> requests, the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> coordinates of the window
    relative to its parent window.</p>
<p>%A</p>
<p>:   Substitutes the UNICODE character corresponding to the event, or the
    empty string if the event does not correspond to a UNICODE character
    (e.g. the shift key was pressed). On X11, <strong>XmbLookupString</strong> (or
    <strong>XLookupString</strong> when input method support is turned off) does all
    the work of translating from the event to a UNICODE character. On
    X11, valid only for <strong>KeyPress</strong> event. On Windows and macOS/aqua,
    valid only for <strong>KeyPress</strong> and <strong>KeyRelease</strong> events.</p>
<p>%B</p>
<p>:   The <em>border_width</em> field from the event. Valid only for
    <strong>Configure</strong>, <strong>ConfigureRequest</strong>, and <strong>Create</strong> events.</p>
<p>%D</p>
<p>:   This reports the <em>delta</em> value of a <strong>MouseWheel</strong> event. The
    <em>delta</em> value represents the rotation units the mouse wheel has been
    moved. The sign of the value represents the direction the mouse
    wheel was scrolled.</p>
<p>%E</p>
<p>:   The <em>send_event</em> field from the event. Valid for all event types.
    <strong>0</strong> indicates that this is a event, <strong>1</strong> indicates that it is a
    event generated by <strong>SendEvent</strong>.</p>
<p>%K</p>
<p>:   The keysym corresponding to the event, substituted as a textual
    string. Valid only for <strong>KeyPress</strong> and <strong>KeyRelease</strong> events.</p>
<p>%M</p>
<p>:   The number of script-based binding patterns matched so far for the
    event. Valid for all event types.</p>
<p>%N</p>
<p>:   The keysym corresponding to the event, substituted as a decimal
    number. Valid only for <strong>KeyPress</strong> and <strong>KeyRelease</strong> events.</p>
<p>%P</p>
<p>:   The name of the property being updated or deleted (which may be
    converted to an XAtom using <strong>winfo atom</strong>.) Valid only for
    <strong>Property</strong> events.</p>
<p>%R</p>
<p>:   The <em>root</em> window identifier from the event. Valid only for events
    containing a <em>root</em> field.</p>
<p>%S</p>
<p>:   The <em>subwindow</em> window identifier from the event, formatted as a
    hexadecimal number. Valid only for events containing a <em>subwindow</em>
    field.</p>
<p>%T</p>
<p>:   The <em>type</em> field from the event. Valid for all event types.</p>
<p>%W</p>
<p>:   The path name of the window to which the event was reported (the
    <em>window</em> field from the event). Valid for all event types.</p>
<p>%X, %Y</p>
<p>:   The <em>x_root</em> and <em>y_root</em> fields from the event. If a virtual-root
    window manager is being used then the substituted values are the
    corresponding x-coordinate and y-coordinate in the virtual root.
    Valid only for <strong>ButtonPress</strong>, <strong>ButtonRelease</strong>, <strong>Enter</strong>,
    <strong>KeyPress</strong>, <strong>KeyRelease</strong>, <strong>Leave</strong> and <strong>Motion</strong> events. Same
    meaning as <strong>%x</strong> and <strong>%y</strong>, except relative to the (virtual) root
    window.</p>
<p>The replacement string for a %-replacement is formatted as a proper Tcl
list element. This means that spaces or special characters such as
<strong>\$</strong> and <strong>{</strong> may be preceded by backslashes. This guarantees that
the string will be passed through the Tcl parser when the binding script
is evaluated. Most replacements are numbers or well-defined strings such
as <strong>Above</strong>; for these replacements no special formatting is ever
necessary. The most common case where reformatting occurs is for the
<strong>%A</strong> substitution. For example, if <em>script</em> is</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>insert %A
</code></pre></div>
<p>and the character typed is an open square bracket, then the script
actually executed will be</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>insert \[
</code></pre></div>
<p>This will cause the <strong>insert</strong> to receive the original replacement
string (open square bracket) as its first argument. If the extra
backslash had not been added, Tcl would not have been able to parse the
script correctly.</p>
<h1 id="multiple-matches">MULTIPLE MATCHES</h1>
<p>It is possible for several bindings to match a given X event. If the
bindings are associated with different <em>tag</em>\'s, then each of the
bindings will be executed, in order. By default, a binding for the
widget will be executed first, followed by a class binding, a binding
for its toplevel, and an <strong>all</strong> binding. The <strong>bindtags</strong> command may
be used to change this order for a particular window or to associate
additional binding tags with the window.</p>
<p>The <strong>continue</strong> and <strong>break</strong> commands may be used inside a binding
script to control the processing of matching scripts. If <strong>continue</strong> is
invoked within a binding script, then this binding script, including all
other appended scripts, is terminated but Tk will continue processing
binding scripts associated with other <em>tag</em>\'s. If the <strong>break</strong> command
is invoked within a binding script, then that script terminates and no
other scripts will be invoked for the event.</p>
<p>Within a script called from the binding script, <strong>return</strong> <strong>-code ok</strong>
may be used to continue processing (including appended scripts), or
<strong>return</strong> <strong>-code break</strong> may be used to stop processing all other
binding scripts.</p>
<p>If more than one binding matches a particular event and they have the
same <em>tag</em>, then the most specific binding is chosen and its script is
evaluated. The following tests are applied, in order, to determine which
of several matching sequences is more specific:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(a) an event pattern that specifies a specific button or key is more
    specific than one that does not;</p>
<p>(b) a longer sequence (in terms of number of events matched) is more
    specific than a shorter sequence;</p>
<p>(c) if the modifiers specified in one pattern are a subset of the
    modifiers in another pattern, then the pattern with more modifiers
    is more specific;</p>
<p>(d) a virtual event whose physical pattern matches the sequence is
    less specific than the same physical pattern that is not
    associated with a virtual event;</p>
<p>(e) given a sequence that matches two or more virtual events, one of
    the virtual events will be chosen, but the order is undefined.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the matching sequences contain more than one event, then tests
(c)-(e) are applied in order from the most recent event to the least
recent event in the sequences. If these tests fail to determine a
winner, then the most recently registered sequence is the winner.</p>
<p>If there are two (or more) virtual events that are both triggered by the
same sequence, and both of those virtual events are bound to the same
window tag, then only one of the virtual events will be triggered, and
it will be picked at random:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>event add &lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt; &lt;Control-y&gt;
event add &lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt; &lt;Button-2&gt;
event add &lt;&lt;Scroll&gt;&gt; &lt;Button-2&gt;
bind Entry &lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt; {puts Paste}
bind Entry &lt;&lt;Scroll&gt;&gt; {puts Scroll}
</code></pre></div>
<p>If the user types Control-y, the <strong>\&lt;\&lt;Paste>></strong> binding will be
invoked, but if the user presses button 2 then one of either the
<strong>\&lt;\&lt;Paste>></strong> or the <strong>\&lt;\&lt;Scroll>></strong> bindings will be invoked,
but exactly which one gets invoked is undefined.</p>
<p>If an X event does not match any of the existing bindings, then the
event is ignored. An unbound event is not considered to be an error.</p>
<h1 id="multi-event-sequences-and-ignored-events">MULTI-EVENT SEQUENCES AND IGNORED EVENTS</h1>
<p>When a <em>sequence</em> specified in a <strong>bind</strong> command contains more than one
event pattern, then its script is executed whenever the recent events
(leading up to and including the current event) match the given
sequence. This means, for example, that if button 1 is clicked
repeatedly the sequence <strong>\&lt;Double-ButtonPress-1></strong> will match each
button press but the first. If extraneous events that would prevent a
match occur in the middle of an event sequence then the extraneous
events are ignored unless they are <strong>KeyPress</strong> or <strong>ButtonPress</strong>
events. For example, <strong>\&lt;Double-ButtonPress-1></strong> will match a sequence
of presses of button 1, even though there will be <strong>ButtonRelease</strong>
events (and possibly <strong>Motion</strong> events) between the <strong>ButtonPress</strong>
events. Furthermore, a <strong>KeyPress</strong> event may be preceded by any number
of other <strong>KeyPress</strong> events for modifier keys without the modifier keys
preventing a match. For example, the event sequence <strong>aB</strong> will match a
press of the <strong>a</strong> key, a release of the <strong>a</strong> key, a press of the
<strong>Shift</strong> key, and a press of the <strong>b</strong> key: the press of <strong>Shift</strong> is
ignored because it is a modifier key. Finally, if several <strong>Motion</strong>
events occur in a row, only the last one is used for purposes of
matching binding sequences.</p>
<h1 id="errors">ERRORS</h1>
<p>If an error occurs in executing the script for a binding then the
<strong>bgerror</strong> mechanism is used to report the error. The <strong>bgerror</strong>
command will be executed at global level (outside the context of any Tcl
procedure).</p>
<h1 id="examples">EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>Arrange for a string describing the motion of the mouse to be printed
out when the mouse is double-clicked:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>bind . &lt;Double-1&gt; {
    puts &quot;hi from (%x,%y)&quot;
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>A little GUI that displays what the keysym name of the last key pressed
is:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>set keysym &quot;Press any key&quot;
pack [label .l -textvariable keysym -padx 2m -pady 1m]
bind . &lt;Key&gt; {
    set keysym &quot;You pressed %K&quot;
}
</code></pre></div>
