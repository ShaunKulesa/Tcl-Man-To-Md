<h1 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>canvas</strong> command creates a new window (given by the <em>pathName</em>
argument) and makes it into a canvas widget. Additional options,
described above, may be specified on the command line or in the option
database to configure aspects of the canvas such as its colors and 3-D
relief. The <strong>canvas</strong> command returns its <em>pathName</em> argument. At the
time this command is invoked, there must not exist a window named
<em>pathName</em>, but <em>pathName</em>\'s parent must exist.</p>
<p>Canvas widgets implement structured graphics. A canvas displays any
number of <em>items</em>, which may be things like rectangles, circles, lines,
and text. Items may be manipulated (e.g. moved or re-colored) and
commands may be associated with items in much the same way that the
<strong>bind</strong> command allows commands to be bound to widgets. For example, a
particular command may be associated with the \&lt;Button-1> event so that
the command is invoked whenever button 1 is pressed with the mouse
cursor over an item. This means that items in a canvas can have
behaviors defined by the Tcl scripts bound to them.</p>
<h1 id="display-list">DISPLAY LIST</h1>
<p>The items in a canvas are ordered for purposes of display, with the
first item in the display list being displayed first, followed by the
next item in the list, and so on. Items later in the display list
obscure those that are earlier in the display list and are sometimes
referred to as being of earlier items. When a new item is created it is
placed at the end of the display list, on top of everything else. Widget
commands may be used to re-arrange the order of the display list.</p>
<p>Window items are an exception to the above rules. The underlying window
systems require them always to be drawn on top of other items. In
addition, the stacking order of window items is not affected by any of
the canvas widget commands; you must use the Tk <strong>raise</strong> command and
<strong>lower</strong> command instead.</p>
<h1 id="item-ids-and-tags">ITEM IDS AND TAGS</h1>
<p>Items in a canvas widget may be named in either of two ways: by id or by
tag. Each item has a unique identifying number, which is assigned to
that item when it is created. The id of an item never changes and id
numbers are never re-used within the lifetime of a canvas widget.</p>
<p>Each item may also have any number of <em>tags</em> associated with it. A tag
is just a string of characters, and it may take any form except that of
an integer. For example, is OK but is not. The same tag may be
associated with many different items. This is commonly done to group
items in various interesting ways; for example, all selected items might
be given the tag</p>
<p>The tag <strong>all</strong> is implicitly associated with every item in the canvas;
it may be used to invoke operations on all the items in the canvas.</p>
<p>The tag <strong>current</strong> is managed automatically by Tk; it applies to the
<em>current item</em>, which is the topmost item whose drawn area covers the
position of the mouse cursor (different item types interpret this in
varying ways; see the individual item type documentation for details).
If the mouse is not in the canvas widget or is not over an item, then no
item has the <strong>current</strong> tag.</p>
<p>When specifying items in canvas widget commands, if the specifier is an
integer then it is assumed to refer to the single item with that id. If
the specifier is not an integer, then it is assumed to refer to all of
the items in the canvas that have a tag matching the specifier. The
symbol <em>tagOrId</em> is used below to indicate that an argument specifies
either an id that selects a single item or a tag that selects zero or
more items.</p>
<p><em>tagOrId</em> may contain a logical expressions of tags by using operators:
and parenthesized subexpressions. For example:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>      .c find withtag {(a&amp;&amp;!b)||(!a&amp;&amp;b)}
</code></pre></div>
<p>or equivalently:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>      .c find withtag {a^b}
</code></pre></div>
<p>will find only those items with either or tags, but not both.</p>
<p>Some widget commands only operate on a single item at a time; if
<em>tagOrId</em> is specified in a way that names multiple items, then the
normal behavior is for the command to use the first (lowest) of these
items in the display list that is suitable for the command. Exceptions
are noted in the widget command descriptions below.</p>
<h1 id="coordinates">COORDINATES</h1>
<p>All coordinates related to canvases are stored as floating-point
numbers. Coordinates and distances are specified in screen units, which
are floating-point numbers optionally followed by one of several
letters. If no letter is supplied then the distance is in pixels. If the
letter is <strong>m</strong> then the distance is in millimeters on the screen; if it
is <strong>c</strong> then the distance is in centimeters; <strong>i</strong> means inches, and
<strong>p</strong> means printers points (1/72 inch). Larger y-coordinates refer to
points lower on the screen; larger x-coordinates refer to points farther
to the right. Coordinates can be specified either as an even number of
parameters, or as a single list parameter containing an even number of x
and y coordinate values.</p>
<h2 id="transformations">TRANSFORMATIONS</h2>
<p>Normally the origin of the canvas coordinate system is at the upper-left
corner of the window containing the canvas. It is possible to adjust the
origin of the canvas coordinate system relative to the origin of the
window using the <strong>xview</strong> and <strong>yview</strong> widget commands; this is
typically used for scrolling. Canvases do not support scaling or
rotation of the canvas coordinate system relative to the window
coordinate system.</p>
<p>Individual items may be moved or scaled using widget commands described
below, but they may not be rotated.</p>
<p>Note that the default origin of the canvas\'s visible area is coincident
with the origin for the whole window as that makes bindings using the
mouse position easier to work with; you only need to use the <strong>canvasx</strong>
and <strong>canvasy</strong> widget commands if you adjust the origin of the visible
area. However, this also means that any focus ring (as controlled by the
<strong>-highlightthickness</strong> option) and window border (as controlled by the
<strong>-borderwidth</strong> option) must be taken into account before you get to
the visible area of the canvas.</p>
<h1 id="indices">INDICES</h1>
<p>Text items support the notion of an <em>index</em> for identifying particular
positions within the item. In a similar fashion, line and polygon items
support <em>index</em> for identifying, inserting and deleting subsets of their
coordinates. Indices are used for commands such as inserting or deleting
a range of characters or coordinates, and setting the insertion cursor
position. An index may be specified in any of a number of ways, and
different types of items may support different forms for specifying
indices. Text items support the following forms for an index; if you
define new types of text-like items, it would be advisable to support as
many of these forms as practical. Note that it is possible to refer to
the character just after the last one in the text item; this is
necessary for such tasks as inserting new text at the end of the item.
Lines and Polygons do not support the insertion cursor and the
selection. Their indices are supposed to be even always, because
coordinates always appear in pairs.</p>
<p><em>number</em></p>
<p>:   A decimal number giving the position of the desired character within
    the text item. 0 refers to the first character, 1 to the next
    character, and so on. If indexes are odd for lines and polygons,
    they will be automatically decremented by one. A number less than 0
    is treated as if it were zero, and a number greater than the length
    of the text item is treated as if it were equal to the length of the
    text item. For polygons, numbers less than 0 or greater than the
    length of the coordinate list will be adjusted by adding or
    subtracting the length until the result is between zero and the
    length, inclusive.</p>
<p><strong>end</strong></p>
<p>:   Refers to the character or coordinate just after the last one in the
    item (same as the number of characters or coordinates in the item).</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong></p>
<p>:   Refers to the character just before which the insertion cursor is
    drawn in this item. Not valid for lines and polygons.</p>
<p><strong>sel.first</strong></p>
<p>:   Refers to the first selected character in the item. If the selection
    is not in this item then this form is illegal.</p>
<p><strong>sel.last</strong></p>
<p>:   Refers to the last selected character in the item. If the selection
    is not in this item then this form is illegal.</p>
<p><strong>@</strong><em>x,y</em></p>
<p>:   Refers to the character or coordinate at the point given by <em>x</em> and
    <em>y</em>, where <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> are specified in the coordinate system of the
    canvas. If <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> lie outside the coordinates covered by the
    text item, then they refer to the first or last character in the
    line that is closest to the given point.</p>
<h1 id="dash-patterns">DASH PATTERNS</h1>
<p>Many items support the notion of a dash pattern for outlines.</p>
<p>The first possible syntax is a list of integers. Each element represents
the number of pixels of a line segment. Only the odd segments are drawn
using the color. The other segments are drawn transparent.</p>
<p>The second possible syntax is a character list containing only 5
possible characters The space can be used to enlarge the space between
other line elements, and cannot occur as the first position in the
string. Some examples:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>-dash .     → -dash {2 4}
-dash -     → -dash {6 4}
-dash -.    → -dash {6 4 2 4}
-dash -..   → -dash {6 4 2 4 2 4}
-dash {. }  → -dash {2 8}
-dash ,     → -dash {4 4}
</code></pre></div>
<p>The main difference of this syntax with the previous is that it is
shape-conserving. This means that all values in the dash list will be
multiplied by the line width before display. This assures that will
always be displayed as a dot and always as a dash regardless of the line
width.</p>
<p>On systems which support only a limited set of dash patterns, the dash
pattern will be displayed as the closest dash pattern that is available.
For example, on Windows only the first 4 of the above examples are
available. The last 2 examples will be displayed identically to the
first one.</p>
<h1 id="widget-command">WIDGET COMMAND</h1>
<p>The <strong>canvas</strong> command creates a new Tcl command whose name is
<em>pathName</em>. This command may be used to invoke various operations on the
widget. It has the following general form:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>pathName option ?arg arg ...?
</code></pre></div>
<p><em>Option</em> and the <em>arg</em>s determine the exact behavior of the command. The
following widget commands are possible for canvas widgets:</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>addtag </strong><em>tag searchSpec </em>?<em>arg arg ...</em>?</p>
<p>:   For each item that meets the constraints specified by <em>searchSpec</em>
    and the <em>arg</em>s, add <em>tag</em> to the list of tags associated with the
    item if it is not already present on that list. It is possible that
    no items will satisfy the constraints given by <em>searchSpec</em> and
    <em>arg</em>s, in which case the command has no effect. This command
    returns an empty string as result. <em>SearchSpec</em> and <em>arg</em>\'s may
    take any of the following forms:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>**above ***tagOrId*

:   Selects the item just after (above) the one given by *tagOrId*
    in the display list. If *tagOrId* denotes more than one item,
    then the last (topmost) of these items in the display list is
    used.

**all**

:   Selects all the items in the canvas.

**below ***tagOrId*

:   Selects the item just before (below) the one given by *tagOrId*
    in the display list. If *tagOrId* denotes more than one item,
    then the first (lowest) of these items in the display list is
    used.

**closest ***x y *?*halo*? ?*start*?

:   Selects the item closest to the point given by *x* and *y*. If
    more than one item is at the same closest distance (e.g. two
    items overlap the point), then the top-most of these items (the
    last one in the display list) is used. If *halo* is specified,
    then it must be a non-negative value. Any item closer than
    *halo* to the point is considered to overlap it. The *start*
    argument may be used to step circularly through all the closest
    items. If *start* is specified, it names an item using a tag or
    id (if by tag, it selects the first item in the display list
    with the given tag). Instead of selecting the topmost closest
    item, this form will select the topmost closest item that is
    below *start* in the display list; if no such item exists, then
    the selection behaves as if the *start* argument had not been
    specified.

**enclosed** *x1* *y1* *x2* *y2*

:   Selects all the items completely enclosed within the rectangular
    region given by *x1*, *y1*, *x2*, and *y2*. *X1* must be no
    greater than *x2* and *y1* must be no greater than *y2*.

**overlapping** *x1* *y1* *x2* *y2*

:   Selects all the items that overlap or are enclosed within the
    rectangular region given by *x1*, *y1*, *x2*, and *y2*. *X1*
    must be no greater than *x2* and *y1* must be no greater than
    *y2*.

**withtag ***tagOrId*

:   Selects all the items given by *tagOrId*.

<p><em>pathName </em><strong>bbox </strong><em>tagOrId</em> ?<em>tagOrId tagOrId ...</em>?</p>
<p>:   Returns a list with four elements giving an approximate bounding box
    for all the items named by the <em>tagOrId</em> arguments. The list has the
    form such that the drawn areas of all the named elements are within
    the region bounded by <em>x1</em> on the left, <em>x2</em> on the right, <em>y1</em> on
    the top, and <em>y2</em> on the bottom. The return value may overestimate
    the actual bounding box by a few pixels. If no items match any of
    the <em>tagOrId</em> arguments or if the matching items have empty bounding
    boxes (i.e. they have nothing to display) then an empty string is
    returned.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>bind </strong><em>tagOrId</em> ?<em>sequence</em>? ?<em>command</em>?</p>
<p>:   This command associates <em>command</em> with all the items given by
    <em>tagOrId</em> such that whenever the event sequence given by <em>sequence</em>
    occurs for one of the items the command will be invoked. This widget
    command is similar to the <strong>bind</strong> command except that it operates
    on items in a canvas rather than entire widgets. See the <strong>bind</strong>
    manual entry for complete details on the syntax of <em>sequence</em> and
    the substitutions performed on <em>command</em> before invoking it. If all
    arguments are specified then a new binding is created, replacing any
    existing binding for the same <em>sequence</em> and <em>tagOrId</em> (if the first
    character of <em>command</em> is then <em>command</em> augments an existing
    binding rather than replacing it). In this case the return value is
    an empty string. If <em>command</em> is omitted then the command returns
    the <em>command</em> associated with <em>tagOrId</em> and <em>sequence</em> (an error
    occurs if there is no such binding). If both <em>command</em> and
    <em>sequence</em> are omitted then the command returns a list of all the
    sequences for which bindings have been defined for <em>tagOrId</em>.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>The only events for which bindings may be specified are those
related to the mouse and keyboard (such as **Enter**, **Leave**,
**ButtonPress**, **Motion**, and **KeyPress**) or virtual events.
The handling of events in canvases uses the current item defined in
**ITEM IDS AND TAGS** above. **Enter** and **Leave** events trigger
for an item when it becomes the current item or ceases to be the
current item; note that these events are different than **Enter**
and **Leave** events for windows. Mouse-related events are directed
to the current item, if any. Keyboard-related events are directed to
the focus item, if any (see the **focus** widget command below for
more on this). If a virtual event is used in a binding, that binding
can trigger only if the virtual event is defined by an underlying
mouse-related or keyboard-related event.

It is possible for multiple bindings to match a particular event.
This could occur, for example, if one binding is associated with the
item\&#39;s id and another is associated with one of the item\&#39;s tags.
When this occurs, all of the matching bindings are invoked. A
binding associated with the **all** tag is invoked first, followed
by one binding for each of the item\&#39;s tags (in order), followed by
a binding associated with the item\&#39;s id. If there are multiple
matching bindings for a single tag, then only the most specific
binding is invoked. A **continue** command in a binding script
terminates that script, and a **break** command terminates that
script and skips any remaining scripts for the event, just as for
the **bind** command.

If bindings have been created for a canvas window using the **bind**
command, then they are invoked in addition to bindings created for
the canvas\&#39;s items using the **bind** widget command. The bindings
for items will be invoked before any of the bindings for the window
as a whole.

<p><em>pathName </em><strong>canvasx </strong><em>screenx</em> ?<em>gridspacing</em>?</p>
<p>:   Given a window x-coordinate in the canvas <em>screenx</em>, this command
    returns the canvas x-coordinate that is displayed at that location.
    If <em>gridspacing</em> is specified, then the canvas coordinate is rounded
    to the nearest multiple of <em>gridspacing</em> units.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>canvasy </strong><em>screeny</em> ?<em>gridspacing</em>?</p>
<p>:   Given a window y-coordinate in the canvas <em>screeny</em> this command

    to the nearest multiple of <em>gridspacing</em> units.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>cget</strong> <em>option</em></p>

<p><em>pathName </em><strong>configure ?</strong><em>option</em>? ?<em>value</em>? ?<em>option value ...</em>?</p>
<p>:   Query or modify the configuration options of the widget. If no
    <em>option</em> is specified, returns a list describing all of the
    available options for <em>pathName</em> (see <strong>Tk_ConfigureInfo</strong> for
    information on the format of this list). If <em>option</em> is specified
    with no <em>value</em>, then the command returns a list describing the one
    named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
    sublist of the value returned if no <em>option</em> is specified). If one
    or more <em>option-value</em> pairs are specified, then the command
    modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s); in
    this case the command returns an empty string. <em>Option</em> may have any
    of the values accepted by the <strong>canvas</strong> command.</p>

<p>:   </p>
<p><em>pathName</em> <strong>coords </strong><em>tagOrId </em>?<em>coordList</em>?</p>
<p>:   Query or modify the coordinates that define an item. If no
    coordinates are specified, this command returns a list whose
    elements are the coordinates of the item named by <em>tagOrId</em>. If
    coordinates are specified, then they replace the current coordinates
    for the named item. If <em>tagOrId</em> refers to multiple items, then the
    first one in the display list is used.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Note that for rectangles, ovals and arcs the returned list of
coordinates has a fixed order, namely the left, top, right and

<p>:   </p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>create </strong><em>type coordList </em>?<em>option value ...</em>?</p>
<p>:   Create a new item in <em>pathName</em> of type <em>type</em>. The exact format of
    the arguments after <em>type</em> depends on <em>type</em>, but usually they
    consist of the coordinates for one or more points, followed by
    specifications for zero or more item options. See the subsections on
    individual item types below for more on the syntax of this command.
    This command returns the id for the new item.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>dchars </strong><em>tagOrId first </em>?<em>last</em>?</p>
<p>:   For each item given by <em>tagOrId</em>, delete the characters, or
    coordinates, in the range given by <em>first</em> and <em>last</em>, inclusive. If
    some of the items given by <em>tagOrId</em> do not support indexing
    operations then they ignore this operation. Text items interpret
    <em>first</em> and <em>last</em> as indices to a character, line and polygon items
    interpret them as indices to a coordinate (an x,y pair). Indices are
    described in <strong>INDICES</strong> above. If <em>last</em> is omitted, it defaults to
    <em>first</em>. This command returns an empty string.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>delete </strong>?<em>tagOrId tagOrId ...</em>?</p>
<p>:   Delete each of the items given by each <em>tagOrId</em>, and return an
    empty string.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>dtag </strong><em>tagOrId </em>?<em>tagToDelete</em>?</p>
<p>:   For each of the items given by <em>tagOrId</em>, delete the tag given by
    <em>tagToDelete</em> from the list of those associated with the item. If an
    item does not have the tag <em>tagToDelete</em> then the item is unaffected
    by the command. If <em>tagToDelete</em> is omitted then it defaults to
    <em>tagOrId</em>. This command returns an empty string.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>find </strong><em>searchCommand </em>?<em>arg arg ...</em>?</p>
<p>:   This command returns a list consisting of all the items that meet
    the constraints specified by <em>searchCommand</em> and <em>arg</em>\'s.
    <em>SearchCommand</em> and <em>args</em> have any of the forms accepted by the
    <strong>addtag</strong> command. The items are returned in stacking order, with
    the lowest item first.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>focus </strong>?<em>tagOrId</em>?</p>
<p>:   Set the keyboard focus for the canvas widget to the item given by
    <em>tagOrId</em>. If <em>tagOrId</em> refers to several items, then the focus is
    set to the first such item in the display list that supports the
    insertion cursor. If <em>tagOrId</em> does not refer to any items, or if
    none of them support the insertion cursor, then the focus is not
    changed. If <em>tagOrId</em> is an empty string, then the focus item is
    reset so that no item has the focus. If <em>tagOrId</em> is not specified
    then the command returns the id for the item that currently has the
    focus, or an empty string if no item has the focus.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Once the focus has been set to an item, the item will display the

screen (set with the **focus** command) are totally independent: a
given item does not actually have the input focus unless (a) its
canvas is the focus window and (b) the item is the focus item within
the canvas. In most cases it is advisable to follow the **focus**
widget command with the **focus** command to set the focus window to
the canvas (if it was not there already).
</code></pre></div>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>gettags</strong> <em>tagOrId</em></p>
<p>:   Return a list whose elements are the tags associated with the item
    given by <em>tagOrId</em>. If <em>tagOrId</em> refers to more than one item, then
    the tags are returned from the first such item in the display list.
    If <em>tagOrId</em> does not refer to any items, or if the item contains no
    tags, then an empty string is returned.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>icursor </strong><em>tagOrId index</em></p>
<p>:   Set the position of the insertion cursor for the item(s) given by
    <em>tagOrId</em> to just before the character whose position is given by
    <em>index</em>. If some or all of the items given by <em>tagOrId</em> do not
    support an insertion cursor then this command has no effect on them.
    See <strong>INDICES</strong> above for a description of the legal forms for
    <em>index</em>. Note: the insertion cursor is only displayed in an item if
    that item currently has the keyboard focus (see the <strong>focus</strong> widget
    command, above), but the cursor position may be set even when the
    item does not have the focus. This command returns an empty string.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>imove </strong><em>tagOrId index x y</em></p>
<p>:   </p>
<p>This command causes the <em>index</em>\'th coordinate of each of the items
indicated by <em>tagOrId</em> to be relocated to the location (<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>). Each
item interprets <em>index</em> independently according to the rules described
in <strong>INDICES</strong> above. Out of the standard set of items, only line and
polygon items may have their coordinates relocated this way.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>index </strong><em>tagOrId index</em></p>
<p>:   This command returns a decimal string giving the numerical index
    within <em>tagOrId</em> corresponding to <em>index</em>. <em>Index</em> gives a textual
    description of the desired position as described in <strong>INDICES</strong>
    above. Text items interpret <em>index</em> as an index to a character, line
    and polygon items interpret it as an index to a coordinate (an x,y
    pair). The return value is guaranteed to lie between 0 and the
    number of characters, or coordinates, within the item, inclusive. If
    <em>tagOrId</em> refers to multiple items, then the index is processed in
    the first of these items that supports indexing operations (in
    display list order).</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>insert </strong><em>tagOrId beforeThis string</em></p>
<p>:   For each of the items given by <em>tagOrId</em>, if the item supports text
    or coordinate, insertion then <em>string</em> is inserted into the item\'s
    text just before the character, or coordinate, whose index is
    <em>beforeThis</em>. Text items interpret <em>beforeThis</em> as an index to a
    character, line and polygon items interpret it as an index to a
    coordinate (an x,y pair). For lines and polygons the <em>string</em> must
    be a valid coordinate sequence. See <strong>INDICES</strong> above for
    information about the forms allowed for <em>beforeThis</em>. This command
    returns an empty string.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>itemcget</strong> <em>tagOrId</em> <em>option</em></p>
<p>:   Returns the current value of the configuration option for the item
    given by <em>tagOrId</em> whose name is <em>option</em>. This command is similar
    to the <strong>cget</strong> widget command except that it applies to a
    particular item rather than the widget as a whole. <em>Option</em> may have
    any of the values accepted by the <strong>create</strong> widget command when the
    item was created. If <em>tagOrId</em> is a tag that refers to more than one
    item, the first (lowest) such item is used.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>itemconfigure </strong><em>tagOrId</em> ?<em>option</em>? ?<em>value</em>? ?<em>option value ...</em>?</p>
<p>:   This command is similar to the <strong>configure</strong> widget command except
    that it modifies item-specific options for the items given by
    <em>tagOrId</em> instead of modifying options for the overall canvas
    widget. If no <em>option</em> is specified, returns a list describing all
    of the available options for the first item given by <em>tagOrId</em> (see
    <strong>Tk_ConfigureInfo</strong> for information on the format of this list). If
    <em>option</em> is specified with no <em>value</em>, then the command returns a
    list describing the one named option (this list will be identical to
    the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no <em>option</em> is
    specified). If one or more <em>option-value</em> pairs are specified, then
    the command modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given
    value(s) in each of the items given by <em>tagOrId</em>; in this case the
    command returns an empty string. The <em>option</em>s and <em>value</em>s are the
    same as those permissible in the <strong>create</strong> widget command when the
    item(s) were created; see the sections describing individual item
    types below for details on the legal options.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>lower </strong><em>tagOrId </em>?<em>belowThis</em>?</p>
<p>:   Move all of the items given by <em>tagOrId</em> to a new position in the
    display list just before the item given by <em>belowThis</em>. If <em>tagOrId</em>
    refers to more than one item then all are moved but the relative
    order of the moved items will not be changed. <em>BelowThis</em> is a tag
    or id; if it refers to more than one item then the first (lowest) of
    these items in the display list is used as the destination location
    for the moved items. Note: this command has no effect on window
    items. Window items always obscure other item types, and the
    stacking order of window items is determined by the <strong>raise</strong>
    command and <strong>lower</strong> command, not the <strong>raise</strong> widget command and
    <strong>lower</strong> widget command for canvases. This command returns an empty
    string.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>move </strong><em>tagOrId xAmount yAmount</em></p>
<p>:   Move each of the items given by <em>tagOrId</em> in the canvas coordinate
    space by adding <em>xAmount</em> to the x-coordinate of each point
    associated with the item and <em>yAmount</em> to the y-coordinate of each
    point associated with the item. This command returns an empty
    string.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>moveto </strong><em>tagOrId xPos yPos</em></p>
<p>:   </p>
<p>Move the items given by <em>tagOrId</em> in the canvas coordinate space so that
the first coordinate pair (the upper-left corner of the bounding box) of
the first item (the lowest in the display list) with tag <em>tagOrId</em> is
located at position (<em>xPos</em>,<em>yPos</em>). <em>xPos</em> and <em>yPos</em> may be the empty
string, in which case the corresponding coordinate will be unchanged.
All items matching <em>tagOrId</em> remain in the same positions relative to
each other. This command returns an empty string.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>postscript </strong>?<em>option value option value ...</em>?</p>
<p>:   Generate a Postscript representation for part or all of the canvas.
    If the <strong>-file</strong> option is specified then the Postscript is written
    to a file and an empty string is returned; otherwise the Postscript
    is returned as the result of the command. If the interpreter that
    owns the canvas is marked as safe, the operation will fail because
    safe interpreters are not allowed to write files. If the
    <strong>-channel</strong> option is specified, the argument denotes the name of a
    channel already opened for writing. The Postscript is written to
    that channel, and the channel is left open for further writing at
    the end of the operation. The Postscript is created in Encapsulated
    Postscript form using version 3.0 of the Document Structuring
    Conventions. Note: by default Postscript is only generated for
    information that appears in the canvas\'s window on the screen. If
    the canvas is freshly created it may still have its initial size of
    1x1 pixel so nothing will appear in the Postscript. To get around
    this problem either invoke the <strong>update</strong> command to wait for the
    canvas window to reach its final size, or else use the <strong>-width</strong>
    and <strong>-height</strong> options to specify the area of the canvas to print.
    The <em>option</em>-<em>value</em> argument pairs provide additional information
    to control the generation of Postscript. The following options are
    supported:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>**-channel ***channelName*

:   Specifies the name of the channel to which to write the
    Postscript. If this option and the **-file** option are not
    specified then the Postscript is returned as the result of the
    command.

**-colormap ***varName*

:   *VarName* must be the name of an array variable that specifies a
    color mapping to use in the Postscript. Each element of
    *varName* must consist of Postscript code to set a particular
    color value (e.g. When outputting color information in the
    Postscript, Tk checks to see if there is an element of *varName*
    with the same name as the color. If so, Tk uses the value of the
    element as the Postscript command to set the color. If this
    option has not been specified, or if there is no entry in
    *varName* for a given color, then Tk uses the red, green, and
    blue intensities from the X color.

**-colormode ***mode*

:   Specifies how to output color information. *Mode* must be either
    **color** (for full color output), **gray** (convert all colors
    to their gray-scale equivalents) or **mono** (convert all colors
    to black or white).

**-file ***fileName*

:   Specifies the name of the file in which to write the Postscript.
    If this option and the **-channel** option are not specified
    then the Postscript is returned as the result of the command.

**-fontmap ***varName*

:   *VarName* must be the name of an array variable that specifies a
    font mapping to use in the Postscript. Each element of *varName*
    must consist of a Tcl list with two elements, which are the name
    and point size of a Postscript font. When outputting Postscript
    commands for a particular font, Tk checks to see if *varName*
    contains an element with the same name as the font. If there is
    such an element, then the font information contained in that
    element is used in the Postscript. Otherwise Tk attempts to
    guess what Postscript font to use. Tk\&#39;s guesses generally only
    work for well-known fonts such as Times and Helvetica and
    Courier, and only if the X font name does not omit any dashes up
    through the point size. For example,
    **-\*-Courier-Bold-R-Normal\--\*-120-\*** will work but
    **\*Courier-Bold-R-Normal\*120\*** will not; Tk needs the dashes
    to parse the font name).

**-height ***size*

:   Specifies the height of the area of the canvas to print.
    Defaults to the height of the canvas window.

**-pageanchor ***anchor*

:   Specifies which point of the printed area of the canvas should
    appear over the positioning point on the page (which is given by
    the **-pagex** and **-pagey** options). For example,
    **-pageanchor n** means that the top center of the area of the
    canvas being printed (as it appears in the canvas window) should
    be over the positioning point. Defaults to **center**.

**-pageheight ***size*

:   Specifies that the Postscript should be scaled in both x and y
    so that the printed area is *size* high on the Postscript page.
    *Size* consists of a floating-point number followed by **c** for
    centimeters, **i** for inches, **m** for millimeters, or **p**
    or nothing for printer\&#39;s points (1/72 inch). Defaults to the
    height of the printed area on the screen. If both
    **-pageheight** and **-pagewidth** are specified then the scale
    factor from **-pagewidth** is used (non-uniform scaling is not
    implemented).

**-pagewidth ***size*

:   Specifies that the Postscript should be scaled in both x and y
    so that the printed area is *size* wide on the Postscript page.
    *Size* has the same form as for **-pageheight**. Defaults to the
    width of the printed area on the screen. If both **-pageheight**
    and **-pagewidth** are specified then the scale factor from
    **-pagewidth** is used (non-uniform scaling is not implemented).

**-pagex ***position*

:   *Position* gives the x-coordinate of the positioning point on
    the Postscript page, using any of the forms allowed for
    **-pageheight**. Used in conjunction with the **-pagey** and
    **-pageanchor** options to determine where the printed area
    appears on the Postscript page. Defaults to the center of the
    page.

**-pagey ***position*

:   *Position* gives the y-coordinate of the positioning point on
    the Postscript page, using any of the forms allowed for
    **-pageheight**. Used in conjunction with the **-pagex** and
    **-pageanchor** options to determine where the printed area
    appears on the Postscript page. Defaults to the center of the
    page.

**-rotate ***boolean*

:   *Boolean* specifies whether the printed area is to be rotated 90
    degrees. In non-rotated output the x-axis of the printed area
    runs along the short dimension of the page in rotated output the
    x-axis runs along the long dimension of the page Defaults to
    non-rotated.

**-width ***size*

:   Specifies the width of the area of the canvas to print. Defaults
    to the width of the canvas window.

**-x ***position*

:   Specifies the x-coordinate of the left edge of the area of the
    canvas that is to be printed, in canvas coordinates, not window
    coordinates. Defaults to the coordinate of the left edge of the
    window.

**-y ***position*

:   Specifies the y-coordinate of the top edge of the area of the
    canvas that is to be printed, in canvas coordinates, not window
    coordinates. Defaults to the coordinate of the top edge of the
    window.

    for the scaling operation and <em>xScale</em> and <em>yScale</em> identify the
    scale factors for x- and y-coordinates, respectively (a scale factor
    of 1.0 implies no change to that coordinate). For each of the points
    defining each item, the x-coordinate is adjusted to change the
    distance from <em>xOrigin</em> by a factor of <em>xScale</em>. Similarly, each
    y-coordinate is adjusted to change the distance from <em>yOrigin</em> by a
    factor of <em>yScale</em>. This command returns an empty string.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Note that some items have only a single pair of coordinates (e.g.,
text, images and windows) and so scaling of them by this command can
only move them around.
</code></pre></div>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>scan</strong> <em>option args</em></p>
<p>:   This command is used to implement scanning on canvases. It has two
    forms, depending on <em>option</em>:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>*pathName ***scan mark ***x y*

:   Records *x* and *y* and the canvas\&#39;s current view; used in
    conjunction with later **scan dragto** commands. Typically this
    command is associated with a mouse button press in the widget
    and *x* and *y* are the coordinates of the mouse. It returns an
    empty string.

*pathName ***scan dragto ***x y ?gain?*

:   This command computes the difference between its *x* and *y*
    arguments (which are typically mouse coordinates) and the *x*
    and *y* arguments to the last **scan mark** command for the
    widget. It then adjusts the view by *gain* times the difference
    in coordinates, where *gain* defaults to 10. This command is
    typically associated with mouse motion events in the widget, to
    produce the effect of dragging the canvas at high speed through
    its window. The return value is an empty string.
</code></pre></div>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>select </strong><em>option</em> ?<em>tagOrId arg</em>?</p>
<p>:   Manipulates the selection in one of several ways, depending on
    <em>option</em>. The command may take any of the forms described below. In
    all of the descriptions below, <em>tagOrId</em> must refer to an item that
    supports indexing and selection; if it refers to multiple items then
    the first of these that supports indexing and the selection is used.
    <em>Index</em> gives a textual description of a position within <em>tagOrId</em>,
    as described in <strong>INDICES</strong> above.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>*pathName ***select adjust ***tagOrId index*

:   Locate the end of the selection in *tagOrId* nearest to the
    character given by *index*, and adjust that end of the selection
    to be at *index* (i.e. including but not going beyond *index*).
    The other end of the selection is made the anchor point for
    future **select to** commands. If the selection is not currently
    in *tagOrId* then this command behaves the same as the **select
    to** widget command. Returns an empty string.

*pathName ***select clear**

:   Clear the selection if it is in this widget. If the selection is
    not in this widget then the command has no effect. Returns an
    empty string.

*pathName ***select from ***tagOrId index*

:   Set the selection anchor point for the widget to be just before
    the character given by *index* in the item given by *tagOrId*.
    This command does not change the selection; it just sets the
    fixed end of the selection for future **select to** commands.
    Returns an empty string.

*pathName ***select item**

:   Returns the id of the selected item, if the selection is in an
    item in this canvas. If the selection is not in this canvas then
    an empty string is returned.

*pathName ***select to ***tagOrId index*

:   Set the selection to consist of those characters of *tagOrId*
    between the selection anchor point and *index*. The new
    selection will include the character given by *index*; it will
    include the character given by the anchor point only if *index*
    is greater than or equal to the anchor point. The anchor point
    is determined by the most recent **select adjust** or **select
    from** command for this widget. If the selection anchor point
    for the widget is not currently in *tagOrId*, then it is set to
    the same character given by *index*. Returns an empty string.
</code></pre></div>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>type</strong><em> tagOrId</em></p>
<p>:   Returns the type of the item given by <em>tagOrId</em>, such as
    <strong>rectangle</strong> or <strong>text</strong>. If <em>tagOrId</em> refers to more than one
    item, then the type of the first item in the display list is
    returned. If <em>tagOrId</em> does not refer to any items at all then an
    empty string is returned.</p>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>xview </strong>?<em>args</em>?</p>
<p>:   This command is used to query and change the horizontal position of
    the information displayed in the canvas\'s window. It can take any
    of the following forms:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>*pathName ***xview**

:   Returns a list containing two elements. Each element is a real
    fraction between 0 and 1; together they describe the horizontal
    span that is visible in the window. For example, if the first
    element is .2 and the second element is .6, 20% of the canvas\&#39;s
    area (as defined by the **-scrollregion** option) is off-screen
    to the left, the middle 40% is visible in the window, and 40% of
    the canvas is off-screen to the right. These are the same values
    passed to scrollbars via the **-xscrollcommand** option.

*pathName ***xview moveto*** fraction*

:   Adjusts the view in the window so that *fraction* of the total
    width of the canvas is off-screen to the left. *Fraction* must
    be a fraction between 0 and 1.

*pathName ***xview scroll ***number what*

:   This command shifts the view in the window left or right
    according to *number* and *what*. *Number* must be an integer.
    *What* must be either **units** or **pages** or an abbreviation
    of one of these. If *what* is **units**, the view adjusts left
    or right in units of the **xScrollIncrement** option, if it is
    greater than zero, or in units of one-tenth the window\&#39;s width
    otherwise. If *what is ***pages** then the view adjusts in units
    of nine-tenths the window\&#39;s width. If *number* is negative then
    information farther to the left becomes visible; if it is
    positive then information farther to the right becomes visible.
</code></pre></div>
<p><em>pathName </em><strong>yview ?</strong><em>args</em>?</p>
<p>:   This command is used to query and change the vertical position of
    the information displayed in the canvas\'s window. It can take any
    of the following forms:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>*pathName ***yview**

:   Returns a list containing two elements. Each element is a real
    fraction between 0 and 1; together they describe the vertical
    span that is visible in the window. For example, if the first
    element is .6 and the second element is 1.0, the lowest 40% of
    the canvas\&#39;s area (as defined by the **-scrollregion** option)
    is visible in the window. These are the same values passed to
    scrollbars via the **-yscrollcommand** option.

*pathName ***yview moveto*** fraction*

:   Adjusts the view in the window so that *fraction* of the
    canvas\&#39;s area is off-screen to the top. *Fraction* is a
    fraction between 0 and 1.

*pathName ***yview scroll ***number what*

:   This command adjusts the view in the window up or down according
    to *number* and *what*. *Number* must be an integer. *What* must
    be either **units** or **pages**. If *what* is **units**, the
    view adjusts up or down in units of the **yScrollIncrement**
    option, if it is greater than zero, or in units of one-tenth the
    window\&#39;s height otherwise. If *what* is **pages** then the view
    adjusts in units of nine-tenths the window\&#39;s height. If
    *number* is negative then higher information becomes visible; if
    it is positive then lower information becomes visible.

<h1 id="overview-of-item-types">OVERVIEW OF ITEM TYPES</h1>
<p>The sections below describe the various types of items supported by
canvas widgets. Each item type is characterized by two things: first,
the form of the <strong>create</strong> command used to create instances of the type;
and second, a set of configuration options for items of that type, which
may be used in the <strong>create</strong> and <strong>itemconfigure</strong> widget commands.
Most items do not support indexing or selection or the commands related
to them, such as <strong>index</strong> and <strong>insert</strong>. Where items do support these
facilities, it is noted explicitly in the descriptions below. At
present, text, line and polygon items provide this support. For lines
and polygons the indexing facility is used to manipulate the coordinates
of the item.</p>
<h2 id="common-item-options">COMMON ITEM OPTIONS</h2>
<p>Many items share a common set of options. These options are explained
here, and then referred to be each widget type for brevity.</p>
<p><strong>-anchor </strong><em>anchorPos</em></p>
<p>:   <em>AnchorPos</em> tells how to position the item relative to the
    positioning point for the item; it may have any of the forms
    accepted by <strong>Tk_GetAnchor</strong>. For example, if <em>anchorPos</em> is
    <strong>center</strong> then the item is centered on the point; if <em>anchorPos</em> is
    <strong>n</strong> then the item will be drawn so that its top center point is at
    the positioning point. This option defaults to <strong>center</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>-dash </strong><em>pattern</em></p>
<p>:   </p>
<p><strong>-activedash </strong><em>pattern</em></p>
<p>:   </p>
<p><strong>-disableddash </strong><em>pattern</em></p>
<p>:   This option specifies dash patterns for the normal, active state,
    and disabled state of an item. <em>pattern</em> may have any of the forms
    accepted by <strong>Tk_GetDash</strong>. If the dash options are omitted then the
    default is a solid outline. See <strong>DASH PATTERNS</strong> for more
    information.</p>
<p><strong>-dashoffset </strong><em>offset</em></p>
<p>:   The starting <em>offset</em> in pixels into the pattern provided by the
    <strong>-dash</strong> option. <strong>-dashoffset</strong> is ignored if there is no
    <strong>-dash</strong> pattern. The <em>offset</em> may have any of the forms described
    in the <strong>COORDINATES</strong> section above.</p>
<p><strong>-fill </strong><em>color</em></p>
<p>:   </p>
<p><strong>-activefill </strong><em>color</em></p>
<p>:   </p>
<p><strong>-disabledfill </strong><em>color</em></p>
<p>:   Specifies the color to be used to fill item\'s area. in its normal,
    active, and disabled states. The even-odd fill rule is used. <em>Color</em>
    may have any of the forms accepted by <strong>Tk_GetColor</strong>. For the line
    item, it specifies the color of the line drawn. For the text item,
    it specifies the foreground color of the text. If <em>color</em> is an
    empty string (the default for all canvas items except line and
    text), then the item will not be filled.</p>
<p><strong>-outline </strong><em>color</em></p>
<p>:   </p>
<p><strong>-activeoutline </strong><em>color</em></p>
<p>:   </p>
<p><strong>-disabledoutline </strong><em>color</em></p>
<p>:   This option specifies the color that should be used to draw the
    outline of the item in its normal, active and disabled states.
    <em>Color</em> may have any of the forms accepted by <strong>Tk_GetColor</strong>. If
    <em>color</em> is specified as an empty string then no outline is drawn for
    the item.</p>
<p><strong>-offset </strong><em>offset</em></p>
<p>:   Specifies the offset of stipples. The offset value can be of the
    form <strong>x,y</strong> or <em>side</em>, where side can be <strong>n</strong>, <strong>ne</strong>, <strong>e</strong>,
    <strong>se</strong>, <strong>s</strong>, <strong>sw</strong>, <strong>w</strong>, <strong>nw</strong>, or <strong>center</strong>. In the first
    case the origin is the origin of the toplevel of the current window.
    For the canvas itself and canvas objects the origin is the canvas
    origin, but putting <strong>#</strong> in front of the coordinate pair indicates
    using the toplevel origin instead. For canvas objects, the
    <strong>-offset</strong> option is used for stippling as well. For the line and
    polygon canvas items you can also specify an index as argument,
    which connects the stipple origin to one of the coordinate points of
    the line/polygon. Note that stipple offsets are <em>only supported on
    X11</em>; they are silently ignored on other platforms.</p>
<p><strong>-outlinestipple </strong><em>bitmap</em></p>
<p>:   </p>
<p><strong>-activeoutlinestipple </strong><em>bitmap</em></p>
<p>:   </p>
<p><strong>-disabledoutlinestipple </strong><em>bitmap</em></p>
<p>:   This option specifies stipple patterns that should be used to draw
    the outline of the item in its normal, active and disabled states.
    Indicates that the outline for the item should be drawn with a
    stipple pattern; <em>bitmap</em> specifies the stipple pattern to use, in
    any of the forms accepted by <strong>Tk_GetBitmap</strong>. If the <strong>-outline</strong>
    option has not been specified then this option has no effect. If
    <em>bitmap</em> is an empty string (the default), then the outline is drawn
    in a solid fashion. <em>Note that stipples are not well supported on
    platforms that do not</em> use X11 as their drawing API.</p>
<p><strong>-outlineoffset </strong><em>offset</em></p>
<p>:   Specifies the offset of the stipple pattern used for outlines, in
    the same way that the <strong>-outline</strong> option controls fill stipples.
    (See the <strong>-outline</strong> option for a description of the syntax of
    <em>offset</em>.)</p>
<p><strong>-stipple </strong><em>bitmap</em></p>
<p>:   </p>
<p><strong>-activestipple </strong><em>bitmap</em></p>
<p>:   </p>
<p><strong>-disabledstipple </strong><em>bitmap</em></p>
<p>:   This option specifies stipple patterns that should be used to fill
    the item in its normal, active and disabled states. <em>bitmap</em>
    specifies the stipple pattern to use, in any of the forms accepted
    by <strong>Tk_GetBitmap</strong>. If the <strong>-fill</strong> option has not been specified
    then this option has no effect. If <em>bitmap</em> is an empty string (the
    default), then filling is done in a solid fashion. For the text
    item, it affects the actual text. <em>Note that stipples are not well
    supported on platforms that do not</em> use X11 as their drawing API.</p>
<p><strong>-state </strong><em>state</em></p>
<p>:   This allows an item to override the canvas widget\'s global <em>state</em>
    option. It takes the same values: <em>normal</em>, <em>disabled</em> or <em>hidden</em>.</p>
<p><strong>-tags </strong><em>tagList</em></p>
<p>:   Specifies a set of tags to apply to the item. <em>TagList</em> consists of
    a list of tag names, which replace any existing tags for the item.
    <em>TagList</em> may be an empty list.</p>
<p><strong>-width </strong><em>outlineWidth</em></p>
<p>:   </p>
<p><strong>-activewidth </strong><em>outlineWidth</em></p>
<p>:   </p>
<p><strong>-disabledwidth </strong><em>outlineWidth</em></p>
<p>:   Specifies the width of the outline to be drawn around the item\'s
    region, in its normal, active and disabled states. <em>outlineWidth</em>
    may be in any of the forms described in the <strong>COORDINATES</strong> section
    above. If the <strong>-outline</strong> option has been specified as an empty
    string then this option has no effect. This option defaults to 1.0.
    For arcs, wide outlines will be drawn centered on the edges of the
    arc\'s region.</p>
<h1 id="standard-item-types">STANDARD ITEM TYPES</h1>
<h2 id="arc-items">ARC ITEMS</h2>
<p>Items of type <strong>arc</strong> appear on the display as arc-shaped regions. An
arc is a section of an oval delimited by two angles (specified by the
<strong>-start</strong> and <strong>-extent</strong> options) and displayed in one of several ways
(specified by the <strong>-style</strong> option). Arcs are created with widget
commands of the following form:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>pathName create arc x1 y1 x2 y2 ?option value ...?
pathName create arc coordList ?option value ...?
</code></pre></div>
<p>The arguments <em>x1</em>, <em>y1</em>, <em>x2</em>, and <em>y2</em> or <em>coordList</em> give the
coordinates of two diagonally opposite corners of a rectangular region
enclosing the oval that defines the arc. After the coordinates there may
be any number of <em>option</em>-<em>value</em> pairs, each of which sets one of the
configuration options for the item. These same <em>option</em>-<em>value</em> pairs
may be used in <strong>itemconfigure</strong> widget commands to change the item\'s
configuration. An arc item becomes the current item when the mouse
pointer is over any part that is painted or (when fully transparent)
that would be painted if both the <strong>-fill</strong> and <strong>-outline</strong> options
were non-empty.</p>
<p>The following standard options are supported by arcs:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>-dash -activedash
-disableddash -dashoffset
-fill -activefill
-disabledfill -offset
-outline  -activeoutline
-disabledoutline  -outlineoffset
-outlinestipple   -activeoutlinestipple
-disabledoutlinestipple   -stipple
-activestipple    -disabledstipple
-state    -tags
-width    -activewidth
-disabledwidth
</code></pre></div>
</blockquote>
<p>The following extra options are supported for arcs:</p>
<p><strong>-extent </strong><em>degrees</em></p>
<p>:   Specifies the size of the angular range occupied by the arc. The
    arc\'s range extends for <em>degrees</em> degrees counter-clockwise from
    the starting angle given by the <strong>-start</strong> option. <em>Degrees</em> may be
    negative. If it is greater than 360 or less than -360, then
    <em>degrees</em> modulo 360 is used as the extent.</p>
<p><strong>-start </strong><em>degrees</em></p>
<p>:   Specifies the beginning of the angular range occupied by the arc.
    <em>Degrees</em> is given in units of degrees measured counter-clockwise
    from the 3-o\'clock position; it may be either positive or negative.</p>
<p><strong>-style </strong><em>type</em></p>
<p>:   Specifies how to draw the arc. If <em>type</em> is <strong>pieslice</strong> (the
    default) then the arc\'s region is defined by a section of the
    oval\'s perimeter plus two line segments, one between the center of
    the oval and each end of the perimeter section. If <em>type</em> is
    <strong>chord</strong> then the arc\'s region is defined by a section of the
    oval\'s perimeter plus a single line segment connecting the two end
    points of the perimeter section. If <em>type</em> is <strong>arc</strong> then the
    arc\'s region consists of a section of the perimeter alone. In this
    last case the <strong>-fill</strong> option is ignored.</p>
<h2 id="bitmap-items">BITMAP ITEMS</h2>
<p>Items of type <strong>bitmap</strong> appear on the display as images with two
colors, foreground and background. Bitmaps are created with widget
commands of the following form:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>pathName create bitmap x y ?option value ...?
pathName create bitmap coordList ?option value ...?
</code></pre></div>
<p>The arguments <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> or <em>coordList</em> (which must have two elements)
specify the coordinates of a point used to position the bitmap on the
display, as controlled by the <strong>-anchor</strong> option. After the coordinates
there may be any number of <em>option</em>-<em>value</em> pairs, each of which sets
one of the configuration options for the item. These same
<em>option</em>-<em>value</em> pairs may be used in <strong>itemconfigure</strong> widget commands
to change the item\'s configuration. A bitmap item becomes the current
item when the mouse pointer is over any part of its bounding box.</p>
<p>The following standard options are supported by bitmaps:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>-anchor   -state
-tags
</code></pre></div>
</blockquote>
<p>The following extra options are supported for bitmaps:</p>
<p><strong>-background </strong><em>color</em></p>
<p>:   </p>
<p><strong>-activebackground </strong><em>color</em></p>
<p>:   </p>
<p><strong>-disabledbackground </strong><em>color</em></p>
<p>:   Specifies the color to use for each of the bitmap\'s valued pixels
    in its normal, active and disabled states. <em>Color</em> may have any of
    the forms accepted by <strong>Tk_GetColor</strong>. If this option is not
    specified, or if it is specified as an empty string, then nothing is
    displayed where the bitmap pixels are 0; this produces a transparent
    effect.</p>
<p><strong>-bitmap </strong><em>bitmap</em></p>
<p>:   </p>
<p><strong>-activebitmap </strong><em>bitmap</em></p>
<p>:   </p>
<p><strong>-disabledbitmap </strong><em>bitmap</em></p>
<p>:   Specifies the bitmaps to display in the item in its normal, active
    and disabled states. <em>Bitmap</em> may have any of the forms accepted by
    <strong>Tk_GetBitmap</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>-foreground </strong><em>color</em></p>
<p>:   </p>
<p><strong>-activeforeground </strong><em>color</em></p>
<p>:   </p>
<p><strong>-disabledforeground </strong><em>color</em></p>
<p>:   Specifies the color to use for each of the bitmap\'s valued pixels
    in its normal, active and disabled states. <em>Color</em> may have any of
    the forms accepted by <strong>Tk_GetColor</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="image-items">IMAGE ITEMS</h2>
<p>Items of type <strong>image</strong> are used to display images on a canvas. Images
are created with widget commands of the following form:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>pathName create image x y ?option value ...?
pathName create image coordList ?option value ...?
</code></pre></div>
<p>The arguments <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> or <em>coordList</em> specify the coordinates of a
point used to position the image on the display, as controlled by the
<strong>-anchor</strong> option. After the coordinates there may be any number of
<em>option</em>-<em>value</em> pairs, each of which sets one of the configuration
options for the item. These same <em>option</em>-<em>value</em> pairs may be used in
<strong>itemconfigure</strong> widget commands to change the item\'s configuration.
An image item becomes the current item when the mouse pointer is over
any part of its bounding box.</p>
<p>The following standard options are supported by images:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>-anchor   -state
-tags
</code></pre></div>
</blockquote>
<p>The following extra options are supported for images:</p>
<p><strong>-image </strong><em>name</em></p>
<p>:   </p>
<p><strong>-activeimage </strong><em>name</em></p>
<p>:   </p>
<p><strong>-disabledimage </strong><em>name</em></p>
<p>:   Specifies the name of the images to display in the item in is
    normal, active and disabled states. This image must have been
    created previously with the <strong>image create</strong> command.</p>
<h2 id="line-items">LINE ITEMS</h2>
<p>Items of type <strong>line</strong> appear on the display as one or more connected
line segments or curves. Line items support coordinate indexing
operations using the <strong>dchars</strong>, <strong>index</strong> and <strong>insert</strong> widget
commands. Lines are created with widget commands of the following form:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>pathName create line x1 y1... xn yn ?option value ...?
pathName create line coordList ?option value ...?
</code></pre></div>
<p>The arguments <em>x1</em> through <em>yn</em> or <em>coordList</em> give the coordinates for
a series of two or more points that describe a series of connected line
segments. After the coordinates there may be any number of
<em>option</em>-<em>value</em> pairs, each of which sets one of the configuration
options for the item. These same <em>option</em>-<em>value</em> pairs may be used in
<strong>itemconfigure</strong> widget commands to change the item\'s configuration. A
line item is the current item whenever the mouse pointer is over any
segment of the line, whether drawn or not and whether or not the line is
smoothed.</p>
<p>The following standard options are supported by lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>-dash -activedash
-disableddash -dashoffset
-fill -activefill
-disabledfill -stipple
-activestipple    -disabledstipple
-state    -tags
-width    -activewidth
-disabledwidth
</code></pre></div>
</blockquote>
<p>The following extra options are supported for lines:</p>
<p><strong>-arrow </strong><em>where</em></p>
<p>:   Indicates whether or not arrowheads are to be drawn at one or both
    ends of the line. <em>Where</em> must have one of the values <strong>none</strong> (for
    no arrowheads), <strong>first</strong> (for an arrowhead at the first point of
    the line), <strong>last</strong> (for an arrowhead at the last point of the
    line), or <strong>both</strong> (for arrowheads at both ends). This option
    defaults to <strong>none</strong>. When requested to draw an arrowhead, Tk
    internally adjusts the corresponding line end point so that the
    rendered line ends at the neck of the arrowhead rather than at its
    tip so that the line doesn\'t extend past the edge of the arrowhead.
    This may trigger a <strong>Leave</strong> event if the mouse is hovering this
    line end. Conversely, when removing an arrowhead Tk adjusts the
    corresponding line point the other way round, which may trigger an
    <strong>Enter</strong> event.</p>
<p><strong>-arrowshape </strong><em>shape</em></p>
<p>:   This option indicates how to draw arrowheads. The <em>shape</em> argument
    must be a list with three elements, each specifying a distance in
    any of the forms described in the <strong>COORDINATES</strong> section above. The
    first element of the list gives the distance along the line from the
    neck of the arrowhead to its tip. The second element gives the
    distance along the line from the trailing points of the arrowhead to
    the tip, and the third element gives the distance from the outside
    edge of the line to the trailing points. If this option is not
    specified then Tk picks a shape.</p>
<p><strong>-capstyle </strong><em>style</em></p>
<p>:   Specifies the ways in which caps are to be drawn at the endpoints of
    the line. <em>Style</em> may have any of the forms accepted by
    <strong>Tk_GetCapStyle</strong> (<strong>butt</strong>, <strong>projecting</strong>, or <strong>round</strong>). If this
    option is not specified then it defaults to <strong>butt</strong>. Where
    arrowheads are drawn the cap style is ignored.</p>
<p><strong>-joinstyle </strong><em>style</em></p>
<p>:   Specifies the ways in which joints are to be drawn at the vertices
    of the line. <em>Style</em> may have any of the forms accepted by
    <strong>Tk_GetJoinStyle</strong> (<strong>bevel</strong>, <strong>miter</strong>, or <strong>round</strong>). If this
    option is not specified then it defaults to <strong>round</strong>. If the line
    only contains two points then this option is irrelevant.</p>
<p><strong>-smooth </strong><em>smoothMethod</em></p>
<p>:   <em>smoothMethod</em> must have one of the forms accepted by
    <strong>Tcl_GetBoolean</strong> or a line smoothing method. Only <strong>true</strong> and
    <strong>raw</strong> are supported in the core (with <strong>bezier</strong> being an alias
    for <strong>true</strong>), but more can be added at runtime. If a boolean false
    value or empty string is given, no smoothing is applied. A boolean
    truth value assumes <strong>true</strong> smoothing. If the smoothing method is
    <strong>true</strong>, this indicates that the line should be drawn as a curve,
    rendered as a set of quadratic splines: one spline is drawn for the
    first and second line segments, one for the second and third, and so
    on. Straight-line segments can be generated within a curve by
    duplicating the end-points of the desired line segment. If the
    smoothing method is <strong>raw</strong>, this indicates that the line should
    also be drawn as a curve but where the list of coordinates is such
    that the first coordinate pair (and every third coordinate pair
    thereafter) is a knot point on a cubic Bezier curve, and the other
    coordinates are control points on the cubic Bezier curve. Straight
    line segments can be generated within a curve by making control
    points equal to their neighbouring knot points. If the last point is
    a control point and not a knot point, the point is repeated (one or
    two times) so that it also becomes a knot point.</p>
<p><strong>-splinesteps </strong><em>number</em></p>
<p>:   Specifies the degree of smoothness desired for curves: each spline
    will be approximated with <em>number</em> line segments. This option is
    ignored unless the <strong>-smooth</strong> option is true or <strong>raw</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="oval-items">OVAL ITEMS</h2>
<p>Items of type <strong>oval</strong> appear as circular or oval regions on the
display. Each oval may have an outline, a fill, or both. Ovals are
created with widget commands of the following form:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>pathName create oval x1 y1 x2 y2 ?option value ...?
pathName create oval coordList ?option value ...?
</code></pre></div>
<p>The arguments <em>x1</em>, <em>y1</em>, <em>x2</em>, and <em>y2</em> or <em>coordList</em> give the
coordinates of two diagonally opposite corners of a rectangular region
enclosing the oval. The oval will include the top and left edges of the
rectangle not the lower or right edges. If the region is square then the
resulting oval is circular; otherwise it is elongated in shape. After
the coordinates there may be any number of <em>option</em>-<em>value</em> pairs, each
of which sets one of the configuration options for the item. These same
<em>option</em>-<em>value</em> pairs may be used in <strong>itemconfigure</strong> widget commands
to change the item\'s configuration. An oval item becomes the current
item when the mouse pointer is over any part that is painted or (when
fully transparent) that would be painted if both the <strong>-fill</strong> and
<strong>-outline</strong> options were non-empty.</p>
<p>The following standard options are supported by ovals:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>-dash -activedash
-disableddash -dashoffset
-fill -activefill
-disabledfill -offset
-outline  -activeoutline
-disabledoutline  -outlineoffset
-outlinestipple   -activeoutlinestipple
-disabledoutlinestipple   -stipple
-activestipple    -disabledstipple
-state    -tags
-width    -activewidth
-disabledwidth
</code></pre></div>
</blockquote>
<p>There are no oval-specific options.</p>
<h2 id="polygon-items">POLYGON ITEMS</h2>
<p>Items of type <strong>polygon</strong> appear as polygonal or curved filled regions
on the display. Polygon items support coordinate indexing operations
using the <strong>dchars</strong>, <strong>index</strong> and <strong>insert</strong> widget commands. Polygons
are created with widget commands of the following form:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>pathName create polygon x1 y1 ... xn yn ?option value ...?
pathName create polygon coordList ?option value ...?
</code></pre></div>
<p>The arguments <em>x1</em> through <em>yn</em> or <em>coordList</em> specify the coordinates
for three or more points that define a polygon. The first point should
not be repeated as the last to close the shape; Tk will automatically
close the periphery between the first and last points. After the
coordinates there may be any number of <em>option</em>-<em>value</em> pairs, each of
which sets one of the configuration options for the item. These same
<em>option</em>-<em>value</em> pairs may be used in <strong>itemconfigure</strong> widget commands
to change the item\'s configuration. A polygon item is the current item
whenever the mouse pointer is over any part of the polygon, whether
drawn or not and whether or not the outline is smoothed.</p>
<p>The following standard options are supported by polygons:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>-dash -activedash
-disableddash -dashoffset
-fill -activefill
-disabledfill -offset
-outline  -activeoutline
-disabledoutline  -outlineoffset
-outlinestipple   -activeoutlinestipple
-disabledoutlinestipple   -stipple
-activestipple    -disabledstipple
-state    -tags
-width    -activewidth
-disabledwidth
</code></pre></div>
</blockquote>
<p>The following extra options are supported for polygons:</p>
<p><strong>-joinstyle </strong><em>style</em></p>
<p>:   Specifies the ways in which joints are to be drawn at the vertices
    of the outline. <em>Style</em> may have any of the forms accepted by
    <strong>Tk_GetJoinStyle</strong> (<strong>bevel</strong>, <strong>miter</strong>, or <strong>round</strong>). If this
    option is not specified then it defaults to <strong>round</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>-smooth </strong><em>boolean</em></p>
<p>:   <em>Boolean</em> must have one of the forms accepted by <strong>Tcl_GetBoolean</strong>
    or a line smoothing method. Only <strong>true</strong> and <strong>raw</strong> are supported
    in the core (with <strong>bezier</strong> being an alias for <strong>true</strong>), but more
    can be added at runtime. If a boolean false value or empty string is
    given, no smoothing is applied. A boolean truth value assumes
    <strong>true</strong> smoothing. If the smoothing method is <strong>true</strong>, this
    indicates that the polygon should be drawn as a curve, rendered as a
    set of quadratic splines: one spline is drawn for the first and
    second line segments, one for the second and third, and so on.
    Straight-line segments can be generated within a curve by
    duplicating the end-points of the desired line segment. If the
    smoothing method is <strong>raw</strong>, this indicates that the polygon should
    also be drawn as a curve but where the list of coordinates is such
    that the first coordinate pair (and every third coordinate pair
    thereafter) is a knot point on a cubic Bezier curve, and the other
    coordinates are control points on the cubic Bezier curve. Straight
    line segments can be generated within a curve by making control
    points equal to their neighbouring knot points. If the last point is
    not the second point of a pair of control points, the point is
    repeated (one or two times) so that it also becomes the second point
    of a pair of control points (the associated knot point will be the
    first control point).</p>
<p><strong>-splinesteps </strong><em>number</em></p>
<p>:   Specifies the degree of smoothness desired for curves: each spline
    will be approximated with <em>number</em> line segments. This option is
    ignored unless the <strong>-smooth</strong> option is true or <strong>raw</strong>.</p>
<p>Polygon items are different from other items such as rectangles, ovals
and arcs in that interior points are considered to be a polygon (e.g.
for purposes of the <strong>find closest</strong> and <strong>find overlapping</strong> widget
commands) even if it is not filled. For most other item types, an
interior point is considered to be inside the item only if the item is
filled or if it has neither a fill nor an outline. If you would like an
unfilled polygon whose interior points are not considered to be inside
the polygon, use a line item instead.</p>
<h2 id="rectangle-items">RECTANGLE ITEMS</h2>
<p>Items of type <strong>rectangle</strong> appear as rectangular regions on the
display. Each rectangle may have an outline, a fill, or both. Rectangles
are created with widget commands of the following form:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>pathName create rectangle x1 y1 x2 y2 ?option value ...?
pathName create rectangle coordList ?option value ...?
</code></pre></div>
<p>The arguments <em>x1</em>, <em>y1</em>, <em>x2</em>, and <em>y2</em> or <em>coordList</em> (which must have
four elements) give the coordinates of two diagonally opposite corners
of the rectangle (the rectangle will include its upper and left edges
but not its lower or right edges). After the coordinates there may be
any number of <em>option</em>-<em>value</em> pairs, each of which sets one of the
configuration options for the item. These same <em>option</em>-<em>value</em> pairs
may be used in <strong>itemconfigure</strong> widget commands to change the item\'s
configuration. A rectangle item becomes the current item when the mouse
pointer is over any part that is painted or (when fully transparent)
that would be painted if both the <strong>-fill</strong> and <strong>-outline</strong> options
were non-empty.</p>
<p>The following standard options are supported by rectangles:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>-dash -activedash
-disableddash -dashoffset
-fill -activefill
-disabledfill -offset
-outline  -activeoutline
-disabledoutline  -outlineoffset
-outlinestipple   -activeoutlinestipple
-disabledoutlinestipple   -stipple
-activestipple    -disabledstipple
-state    -tags
-width    -activewidth
-disabledwidth
</code></pre></div>
</blockquote>
<p>There are no rectangle-specific options.</p>
<h2 id="text-items">TEXT ITEMS</h2>
<p>A text item displays a string of characters on the screen in one or more
lines. Text items support indexing, editing and selection through the
<strong>dchars</strong> widget command, the <strong>focus</strong> widget command, the <strong>icursor</strong>
widget command, the <strong>index</strong> widget command, the <strong>insert</strong> widget
command, and the <strong>select</strong> widget command. Text items are created with
widget commands of the following form:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>pathName create text x y ?option value ...?
pathName create text coordList ?option value ...?
</code></pre></div>
<p>The arguments <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> or <em>coordList</em> (which must have two elements)
specify the coordinates of a point used to position the text on the
display (see the options below for more information on how text is
displayed). After the coordinates there may be any number of
<em>option</em>-<em>value</em> pairs, each of which sets one of the configuration
options for the item. These same <em>option</em>-<em>value</em> pairs may be used in
<strong>itemconfigure</strong> widget commands to change the item\'s configuration. A
text item becomes the current item when the mouse pointer is over any
part of its bounding box.</p>
<p>The following standard options are supported by text items:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>-anchor   -fill
-activefill   -disabledfill
-stipple  -activestipple
-disabledstipple  -state
-tags
</code></pre></div>
</blockquote>
<p>The following extra options are supported for text items:</p>
<p><strong>-angle </strong><em>rotationDegrees</em></p>
<p>:   </p>
<p><em>RotationDegrees</em> tells how many degrees to rotate the text
anticlockwise about the positioning point for the text; it may have any
floating-point value from 0.0 to 360.0. For example, if
<em>rotationDegrees</em> is <strong>90</strong>, then the text will be drawn vertically from
bottom to top. This option defaults to <strong>0.0</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>-font </strong><em>fontName</em></p>
<p>:   Specifies the font to use for the text item. <em>FontName</em> may be any
    string acceptable to <strong>Tk_GetFont</strong>. If this option is not
    specified, it defaults to a system-dependent font.</p>
<p><strong>-justify </strong><em>how</em></p>
<p>:   Specifies how to justify the text within its bounding region. <em>How</em>
    must be one of the values <strong>left</strong>, <strong>right</strong>, or <strong>center</strong>. This
    option will only matter if the text is displayed as multiple lines.
    If the option is omitted, it defaults to <strong>left</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>-text </strong><em>string</em></p>
<p>:   <em>String</em> specifies the characters to be displayed in the text item.
    Newline characters cause line breaks. The characters in the item may
    also be changed with the <strong>insert</strong> and <strong>delete</strong> widget commands.
    This option defaults to an empty string.</p>
<p><strong>-underline </strong></p>
<p>:   Specifies the integer index of a character within the text to be
    underlined. 0 corresponds to the first character of the text
    displayed, 1 to the next character, and so on. -1 means that no
    underline should be drawn (if the whole text item is to be
    underlined, the appropriate font should be used instead).</p>
<p><strong>-width </strong><em>lineLength</em></p>
<p>:   Specifies a maximum line length for the text, in any of the forms
    described in the <strong>COORDINATES</strong> section above. If this option is
    zero (the default) the text is broken into lines only at newline
    characters. However, if this option is non-zero then any line that
    would be longer than <em>lineLength</em> is broken just before a space
    character to make the line shorter than <em>lineLength</em>; the space
    character is treated as if it were a newline character.</p>
<h2 id="window-items">WINDOW ITEMS</h2>
<p>Items of type <strong>window</strong> cause a particular window to be displayed at a
given position on the canvas. Window items are created with widget
commands of the following form:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>pathName create window x y ?option value ...?
pathName create window coordList ?option value ...?
</code></pre></div>
<p>The arguments <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> or <em>coordList</em> (which must have two elements)
specify the coordinates of a point used to position the window on the
display, as controlled by the <strong>-anchor</strong> option. After the coordinates
there may be any number of <em>option</em>-<em>value</em> pairs, each of which sets
one of the configuration options for the item. These same
<em>option</em>-<em>value</em> pairs may be used in <strong>itemconfigure</strong> widget commands
to change the item\'s configuration. Theoretically, a window item
becomes the current item when the mouse pointer is over any part of its
bounding box, but in practice this typically does not happen because the
mouse pointer ceases to be over the canvas at that point.</p>
<p>The following standard options are supported by window items:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>-anchor   -state
-tags
</code></pre></div>
</blockquote>
<p>The following extra options are supported for window items:</p>
<p><strong>-height </strong><em>pixels</em></p>
<p>:   Specifies the height to assign to the item\'s window. <em>Pixels</em> may
    have any of the forms described in the <strong>COORDINATES</strong> section
    above. If this option is not specified, or if it is specified as
    zero, then the window is given whatever height it requests
    internally.</p>
<p><strong>-width </strong><em>pixels</em></p>
<p>:   Specifies the width to assign to the item\'s window. <em>Pixels</em> may
    have any of the forms described in the <strong>COORDINATES</strong> section
    above. If this option is not specified, or if it is specified as
    zero, then the window is given whatever width it requests
    internally.</p>
<p><strong>-window </strong><em>pathName</em></p>
<p>:   Specifies the window to associate with this item. The window
    specified by <em>pathName</em> must either be a child of the canvas widget
    or a child of some ancestor of the canvas widget. <em>PathName</em> may not
    refer to a top-level window.</p>
<p>Note: due to restrictions in the ways that windows are managed, it is
not possible to draw other graphical items (such as lines and images) on
top of window items. A window item always obscures any graphics that
overlap it, regardless of their order in the display list. Also note
that window items, unlike other canvas items, are not clipped for
display by their containing canvas\'s border, and are instead clipped by
the parent widget of the window specified by the <strong>-window</strong> option;
when the parent widget is the canvas, this means that the window item
can overlap the canvas\'s border.</p>
<h1 id="application-defined-item-types">APPLICATION-DEFINED ITEM TYPES</h1>
<p>It is possible for individual applications to define new item types for
canvas widgets using C code. See the documentation for
<strong>Tk_CreateItemType</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="bindings">BINDINGS</h1>
<p>In the current implementation, new canvases are not given any default
behavior: you will have to execute explicit Tcl commands to give the
canvas its behavior.</p>
<h1 id="credits">CREDITS</h1>
<p>Tk\'s canvas widget is a blatant ripoff of ideas from Joel Bartlett\'s
<em>ezd</em> program. <em>Ezd</em> provides structured graphics in a Scheme
environment and preceded canvases by a year or two. Its simple
mechanisms for placing and animating graphical objects inspired the
functions of canvases.</p>
