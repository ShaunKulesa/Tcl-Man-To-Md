<p>vwait - Process events until a variable is written</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>vwait</strong> <em>varName</em></p>
<p><strong>vwait</strong> ?<em>options</em>? ?<em>varName ...</em>?</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This command enters the Tcl event loop to process events, blocking the
application if no events are ready. It continues processing events until
some event handler sets the value of the global variable <em>varName</em>. Once
<em>varName</em> has been set, the <strong>vwait</strong> command will return as soon as the
event handler that modified <em>varName</em> completes. The <em>varName</em> argument
is always interpreted as a variable name with respect to the global
namespace, but can refer to any namespace\'s variables if the
fully-qualified name is given.</p>
<p>In the second more complex command form <em>options</em> allow for finer
control of the wait operation and to deal with multiple event sources.
<em>Options</em> can be made up of</p>
<p><strong>--</strong></p>
<p>:   Marks the end of options. All following arguments are handled as
    variable names.</p>
<p><strong>-all</strong></p>
<p>:   All conditions for the wait operation must be met to complete the
    wait operation. Otherwise (the default) the first event completes
    the wait.</p>
<p><strong>-extended</strong></p>
<p>:   An extended result in list form is returned, see below for
    explanation.</p>
<p><strong>-nofileevents</strong></p>
<p>:   File events are not handled in the wait operation.</p>
<p><strong>-noidleevents</strong></p>
<p>:   Idle handlers are not invoked during the wait operation.</p>
<p><strong>-notimerevents</strong></p>
<p>:   Timer handlers are not serviced during the wait operation.</p>
<p><strong>-nowindowevents</strong></p>
<p>:   Events of the windowing system are not handled during the wait
    operation.</p>
<p><strong>-readable</strong> <em>channel</em></p>
<p>:   <em>Channel</em> must name a Tcl channel open for reading. If <em>channel</em> is
    or becomes readable the wait operation completes.</p>
<p><strong>-timeout</strong> <em>milliseconds</em></p>
<p>:   The wait operation is constrained to <em>milliseconds</em>.</p>
<p><strong>-variable</strong> <em>varName</em></p>
<p>:   <em>VarName</em> must be the name of a global variable. Writing or
    unsetting this variable completes the wait operation.</p>
<p><strong>-writable</strong> <em>channel</em></p>
<p>:   <em>Channel</em> must name a Tcl channel open for writing. If <em>channel</em> is
    or becomes writable the wait operation completes.</p>
<p>The result returned by <strong>vwait</strong> is for the simple form an empty string.
If the <em>-timeout</em> option is specified, the result is the number of
milliseconds remaining when the wait condition has been met, or -1 if
the wait operation timed out.</p>
<p>If the <em>-extended</em> option is specified, the result is made up of a Tcl
list with an even number of elements. Odd elements take the values
<strong>readable</strong>, <strong>timeleft</strong>, <strong>variable</strong>, and <strong>writable</strong>. Even
elements are the corresponding variable and channel names or the
remaining number of milliseconds. The list is ordered by the occurrences
of the event(s) with the exception of <strong>timeleft</strong> which always comes
last.</p>
<p>In some cases the <strong>vwait</strong> command may not return immediately after
<em>varName</em> et.al. is set. This happens if the event handler that sets
<em>varName</em> does not complete immediately. For example, if an event
handler sets <em>varName</em> and then itself calls <strong>vwait</strong> to wait for a
different variable, then it may not return for a long time. During this
time the top-level <strong>vwait</strong> is blocked waiting for the event handler to
complete, so it cannot return either. (See the <strong>NESTED VWAITS BY
EXAMPLE</strong> below.)</p>
<p>To be clear, <em>multiple </em><strong>vwait</strong><em> calls will nest and will not happen
in</em> parallel. The outermost call to <strong>vwait</strong> will not return until all
the inner ones do. It is recommended that code should never nest
<strong>vwait</strong> calls (by avoiding putting them in event callbacks) but when
that is not possible, care should be taken to add interlock variables to
the code to prevent all reentrant calls to <strong>vwait</strong> that are not
<em>strictly</em> necessary. Be aware that the synchronous modes of operation
of some Tcl packages (e.g., <strong>http</strong>) use <strong>vwait</strong> internally; if using
the event loop, it is best to use the asynchronous callback-based modes
of operation of those packages where available.</p>
<h1 id="examples">EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>Run the event-loop continually until some event calls <strong>exit</strong>. (You can
use any variable not mentioned elsewhere, but the name <em>forever</em> reminds
you at a glance of the intent.)</p>
<p><strong>vwait</strong> forever</p>
<p>Wait five seconds for a connection to a server socket, otherwise close
the socket and continue running the script:</p>
<p># Initialise the state after 5000 set state timeout set server [socket
-server accept 12345] proc accept {args} { global state connectionInfo
set state accepted set connectionInfo \$args }</p>
<p># Wait for something to happen <strong>vwait</strong> state</p>
<p># Clean up events that could have happened close \$server after cancel
set state timeout</p>
<p># Do something based on how the vwait finished... switch \$state {
timeout { puts \"no connection on port 12345\" } accepted { puts
\"connection: \$connectionInfo\" puts [lindex \$connectionInfo 0]
\"Hello there!\" } }</p>
<p>A command that will wait for some time delay by waiting for a namespace
variable to be set. Includes an interlock to prevent nested waits.</p>
<p>namespace eval example { variable v done proc wait {delay} { variable v
if {\$v ne \"waiting\"} { set v waiting after \$delay [namespace code
{set v done}] <strong>vwait</strong> [namespace which -variable v] } return \$v }
}</p>
<p>When running inside a <strong>coroutine</strong>, an alternative to using <strong>vwait</strong>
is to <strong>yield</strong> to an outer event loop and to get recommenced when the
variable is set, or at an idle moment after that.</p>
<p>coroutine task apply {{} { # simulate [after 1000] after 1000 [info
coroutine] yield</p>
<p># schedule the setting of a global variable, as normal after 2000 {set
var 1}</p>
<p># simulate [<strong>vwait</strong> var] proc updatedVar {task args} { after idle
\$task trace remove variable ::var write \"updatedVar \$task\" } trace
add variable ::var write \"updatedVar [info coroutine]\" yield }}</p>
<h2 id="nested-vwaits-by-example">NESTED VWAITS BY EXAMPLE</h2>
<p>This example demonstrates what can happen when the <strong>vwait</strong> command is
nested. The script will never finish because the waiting for the <em>a</em>
variable never finishes; that <strong>vwait</strong> command is still waiting for a
script scheduled with <strong>after</strong> to complete, which just happens to be
running an inner <strong>vwait</strong> (for <em>b</em>) even though the event that the
outer <strong>vwait</strong> was waiting for (the setting of <em>a</em>) has occurred.</p>
<p>after 500 { puts \"waiting for b\" <strong>vwait</strong> b puts \"b was set\" }
after 1000 { puts \"setting a\" set a 10 } puts \"waiting for a\"
<strong>vwait</strong> a puts \"a was set\" puts \"setting b\" set b 42</p>
<p>If you run the above code, you get this output:</p>
<p>waiting for a waiting for b setting a</p>
<p>The script will never print</p>
<p>until after it has printed</p>
<p>because of the nesting of <strong>vwait</strong> commands, and yet <em>b</em> will not be
set until after the outer <strong>vwait</strong> returns, so the script has
deadlocked. The only ways to avoid this are to either structure the
overall program in continuation-passing style or to use <strong>coroutine</strong> to
make the continuations implicit. The first of these options would be
written as:</p>
<p>after 500 { puts \"waiting for b\" trace add variable b write {apply
{args { global a b trace remove variable ::b write \ [lrange [info
level 0] 0 1] puts \"b was set\" set ::done ok }}} } after 1000 { puts
\"setting a\" set a 10 } puts \"waiting for a\" trace add variable a
write {apply {args { global a b trace remove variable a write [lrange
[info level 0] 0 1] puts \"a was set\" puts \"setting b\" set b 42
}}} <strong>vwait</strong> done</p>
<p>The second option, with <strong>coroutine</strong> and some helper procedures, is
done like this:</p>
<p># A coroutine-based wait-for-variable command proc waitvar globalVar {
trace add variable ::\$globalVar write \ [list apply {{v c args} {
trace remove variable \$v write \ [lrange [info level 0] 0 3] after
0 \$c }} ::\$globalVar [info coroutine]] yield } # A coroutine-based
wait-for-some-time command proc waittime ms { after \$ms [info
coroutine] yield }</p>
<p>coroutine task-1 eval { puts \"waiting for a\" waitvar a puts \"a was
set\" puts \"setting b\" set b 42 } coroutine task-2 eval { waittime 500
puts \"waiting for b\" waitvar b puts \"b was set\" set done ok }
coroutine task-3 eval { waittime 1000 puts \"setting a\" set a 10 }
<strong>vwait</strong> done</p>
