<p>next, nextto - invoke superclass method implementations</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre><code>package require tcl::oo

next ?arg ...?
nextto class ?arg ...?
</code></pre>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>next</strong> command is used to call implementations of a method by a
class, superclass or mixin that are overridden by the current method. It
can only be used from within a method. It is also used within filters to
indicate the point where a filter calls the actual implementation (the
filter may decide to not go along the chain, and may process the results
of going along the chain of methods as it chooses). The result of the
<strong>next</strong> command is the result of the next method in the method chain;
if there are no further methods in the method chain, the result of
<strong>next</strong> will be an error. The arguments, <em>arg</em>, to <strong>next</strong> are the
arguments to pass to the next method in the chain.</p>
<p>The <strong>nextto</strong> command is the same as the <strong>next</strong> command, except that
it takes an additional <em>class</em> argument that identifies a class whose
implementation of the current method chain (see <strong>info object</strong>
<strong>call</strong>) should be used; the method implementation selected will be the
one provided by the given class, and it must refer to an existing
non-filter invocation that lies further along the chain than the current
implementation.</p>
<h1 id="the-method-chain">THE METHOD CHAIN</h1>
<p>When a method of an object is invoked, things happen in several stages:</p>
<p>[1]</p>
<p>:   The structure of the object, its class, superclasses, filters, and
    mixins, are examined to build a <em>method chain</em>, which contains a
    list of method implementations to invoke.</p>
<p>[2]</p>
<p>:   The first method implementation on the chain is invoked.</p>
<p>[3]</p>
<p>:   If that method implementation invokes the <strong>next</strong> command, the next
    method implementation is invoked (with its arguments being those
    that were passed to <strong>next</strong>).</p>
<p>[4]</p>
<p>:   The result from the overall method call is the result from the
    outermost method implementation; inner method implementations return
    their results through <strong>next</strong>.</p>
<p>[5]</p>
<p>:   The method chain is cached for future use.</p>
<h2 id="method-search-order">METHOD SEARCH ORDER</h2>
<p>When constructing the method chain, method implementations are searched
for in the following order:</p>
<p>[1]</p>
<p>:   In the classes mixed into the object, in class traversal order. The
    list of mixins is checked in natural order.</p>
<p>[2]</p>
<p>:   In the classes mixed into the classes of the object, with sources of
    mixing in being searched in class traversal order. Within each
    class, the list of mixins is processed in natural order.</p>
<p>[3]</p>
<p>:   In the object itself.</p>
<p>[4]</p>
<p>:   In the object\'s class.</p>
<p>[5]</p>
<p>:   In the superclasses of the class, following each superclass in a
    depth-first fashion in the natural order of the superclass list.</p>
<p>Any particular method implementation always comes as <em>late</em> in the
resulting list of implementations as possible; this means that if some
class, A, is both mixed into a class, B, and is also a superclass of B,
the instances of B will always treat A as a superclass from the
perspective of inheritance. This is true even when the multiple
inheritance is processed indirectly.</p>
<h2 id="filters">FILTERS</h2>
<p>When an object has a list of filter names set upon it, or is an instance
of a class (or has mixed in a class) that has a list of filter names set
upon it, before every invocation of any method the filters are
processed. Filter implementations are found in class traversal order, as
are the lists of filter names (each of which is traversed in natural
list order). Explicitly invoking a method used as a filter will cause
that method to be invoked twice, once as a filter and once as a normal
method.</p>
<p>Each filter should decide for itself whether to permit the execution to
go forward to the proper implementation of the method (which it does by
invoking the <strong>next</strong> command as filters are inserted into the front of
the method call chain) and is responsible for returning the result of
<strong>next</strong>.</p>
<p>Filters are invoked when processing an invocation of the <strong>unknown</strong>
method because of a failure to locate a method implementation, but <em>not</em>
when invoking either constructors or destructors. (Note however that the
<strong>destroy</strong> method is a conventional method, and filters are invoked as
normal when it is called.)</p>
<h1 id="examples">EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>This example demonstrates how to use the <strong>next</strong> command to call the
(super)class\'s implementation of a method. The script:</p>
<p>oo::class create theSuperclass { method example {args} { puts \"in the
superclass, args = \$args\" } }</p>
<p>oo::class create theSubclass { superclass theSuperclass method example
{args} { puts \"before chaining from subclass, args = \$args\" <strong>next</strong>
a {*}\$args b <strong>next</strong> pureSynthesis puts \"after chaining from
subclass\" } }</p>
<p>theSubclass create obj oo::objdefine obj method example args { puts
\"per-object method, args = \$args\" <strong>next</strong> x {*}\$args y <strong>next</strong> }
obj example 1 2 3</p>
<p>prints the following:</p>
<p>per-object method, args = 1 2 3 before chaining from subclass, args = x
1 2 3 y in the superclass, args = a x 1 2 3 y b in the superclass, args
= pureSynthesis after chaining from subclass before chaining from
subclass, args = in the superclass, args = a b in the superclass, args =
pureSynthesis after chaining from subclass</p>
<p>This example demonstrates how to build a simple cache class that applies
memoization to all the method calls of the objects it is mixed into, and
shows how it can make a difference to computation times:</p>
<p>oo::class create cache { filter Memoize method Memoize args { <em># Do not
filter the core method implementations</em> if {[lindex [self target] 0]
eq \"::oo::object\"} { return [<strong>next</strong> {*}\$args] }</p>
<p><em># Check if the value is already in the cache</em> my variable ValueCache
set key [self target],\$args if {[info exist ValueCache(\$key)]} {
return \$ValueCache(\$key) }</p>
<p><em># Compute value, insert into cache, and return it</em> return [set
ValueCache(\$key) [<strong>next</strong> {*}\$args]] }</p>
<p>method flushCache {} { my variable ValueCache unset ValueCache <em># Skip
the caching</em> return -level 2 \"\" } }</p>
<p>oo::object create demo oo::objdefine demo { mixin cache</p>
<p>method compute {a b c} { after 3000 <em>;# Simulate deep thought</em> return
[expr {\$a + \$b * \$c}] }</p>
<p>method compute2 {a b c} { after 3000 <em>;# Simulate deep thought</em> return
[expr {\$a * \$b + \$c}] } }</p>
<p>puts [demo compute 1 2 3] <em>→ prints \"7\" after delay</em> puts [demo
compute2 4 5 6] <em>→ prints \"26\" after delay</em> puts [demo compute 1 2
3] <em>→ prints \"7\" instantly</em> puts [demo compute2 4 5 6] <em>→ prints
\"26\" instantly</em> puts [demo compute 4 5 6] <em>→ prints \"34\" after
delay</em> puts [demo compute 4 5 6] <em>→ prints \"34\" instantly</em> puts
[demo compute 1 2 3] <em>→ prints \"7\" instantly</em> demo flushCache puts
[demo compute 1 2 3] <em>→ prints \"7\" after delay</em></p>
