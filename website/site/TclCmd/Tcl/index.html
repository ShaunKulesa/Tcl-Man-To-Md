<p>Tcl - Tool Command Language</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>Summary of Tcl language syntax.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The following rules define the syntax and semantics of the Tcl language:</p>
<p>[1] Commands.</p>
<p>:   A Tcl script is a string containing one or more commands.
    Semi-colons and newlines are command separators unless quoted as
    described below. Close brackets are command terminators during
    command substitution (see below) unless quoted.</p>
<p>[2] Evaluation.</p>
<p>:   A command is evaluated in two steps. First, the Tcl interpreter
    breaks the command into <em>words</em> and performs substitutions as
    described below. These substitutions are performed in the same way
    for all commands. Secondly, the first word is used to locate a
    command procedure to carry out the command, then all of the words of
    the command are passed to the command procedure. The command
    procedure is free to interpret each of its words in any way it
    likes, such as an integer, variable name, list, or Tcl script.
    Different commands interpret their words differently.</p>
<p>[3] Words.</p>
<p>:   Words of a command are separated by white space (except for
    newlines, which are command separators).</p>
<p>[4] Double quotes.</p>
<p>:   If the first character of a word is double-quote then the word is
    terminated by the next double-quote character. If semi-colons, close
    brackets, or white space characters (including newlines) appear
    between the quotes then they are treated as ordinary characters and
    included in the word. Command substitution, variable substitution,
    and backslash substitution are performed on the characters between
    the quotes as described below. The double-quotes are not retained as
    part of the word.</p>
<p>[5] Argument expansion.</p>
<p>:   If a word starts with the string followed by a non-whitespace
    character, then the leading is removed and the rest of the word is
    parsed and substituted as any other word. After substitution, the
    word is parsed as a list (without command or variable substitutions;
    backslash substitutions are performed as is normal for a list and
    individual internal words may be surrounded by either braces or
    double-quote characters), and its words are added to the command
    being substituted. For instance, is equivalent to</p>
<p>[6] Braces.</p>
<p>:   If the first character of a word is an open brace and rule [5]
    does not apply, then the word is terminated by the matching close
    brace Braces nest within the word: for each additional open brace
    there must be an additional close brace (however, if an open brace
    or close brace within the word is quoted with a backslash then it is
    not counted in locating the matching close brace). No substitutions
    are performed on the characters between the braces except for
    backslash-newline substitutions described below, nor do semi-colons,
    newlines, close brackets, or white space receive any special
    interpretation. The word will consist of exactly the characters
    between the outer braces, not including the braces themselves.</p>
<p>[7] Command substitution.</p>
<p>:   If a word contains an open bracket then Tcl performs <em>command
    substitution</em>. To do this it invokes the Tcl interpreter recursively
    to process the characters following the open bracket as a Tcl
    script. The script may contain any number of commands and must be
    terminated by a close bracket The result of the script (i.e. the
    result of its last command) is substituted into the word in place of
    the brackets and all of the characters between them. There may be
    any number of command substitutions in a single word. Command
    substitution is not performed on words enclosed in braces.</p>
<p>[8] Variable substitution.</p>
<p>:   If a word contains a dollar-sign followed by one of the forms
    described below, then Tcl performs <em>variable</em> substitution: the
    dollar-sign and the following characters are replaced in the word by
    the value of a variable. Variable substitution may take any of the
    following forms:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>**\$***name*

:   *Name* is the name of a scalar variable; the name is a sequence
    of one or more characters that are a letter, digit, underscore,
    or namespace separators (two or more colons). Letters and digits
    are *only* the standard ASCII ones (**0**--**9**, **A**--**Z**
    and **a**--**z**).

**\$***name***(***index***)**

:   *Name* gives the name of an array variable and *index* gives the
    name of an element within that array. *Name* must contain only
    letters, digits, underscores, and namespace separators, and may
    be an empty string. Letters and digits are *only* the standard
    ASCII ones (**0**--**9**, **A**--**Z** and **a**--**z**).
    Command substitutions, variable substitutions, and backslash
    substitutions are performed on the characters of *index*.

**\${***name***}**

:   *Name* is the name of a scalar variable or array element. It may
    contain any characters whatsoever except for close braces. It
    indicates an array element if *name* is in the form where
    *arrayName* does not contain any open parenthesis characters, or
    close brace characters, and *index* can be any sequence of
    characters except for close brace characters. No further
    substitutions are performed during the parsing of *name*.

There may be any number of variable substitutions in a single word.
Variable substitution is not performed on words enclosed in braces.

Note that variables may contain character sequences other than those
listed above, but in that case other mechanisms must be used to
access them (e.g., via the **set** command\&#39;s single-argument form).
</code></pre></div>
<p>[9] Backslash substitution.</p>
<p>:   If a backslash appears within a word then <em>backslash substitution</em>
    occurs. In all cases but those described below the backslash is
    dropped and the following character is treated as an ordinary
    character and included in the word. This allows characters such as
    double quotes, close brackets, and dollar signs to be included in
    words without triggering special processing. The following table
    lists the backslash sequences that are handled specially, along with
    the value that replaces each sequence.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>\\**a**

:   Audible alert (bell) (Unicode U+000007).

\\**b**

:   Backspace (Unicode U+000008).

\\**f**

:   Form feed (Unicode U+00000C).

\\**n**

:   Newline (Unicode U+00000A).

\\**r**

:   Carriage-return (Unicode U+00000D).

\\**t**

:   Tab (Unicode U+000009).

\\**v**

:   Vertical tab (Unicode U+00000B).

\\**\&lt;newline\&gt;***whiteSpace*

:   A single space character replaces the backslash, newline, and
    all spaces and tabs after the newline. This backslash sequence
    is unique in that it is replaced in a separate pre-pass before
    the command is actually parsed. This means that it will be
    replaced even when it occurs between braces, and the resulting
    space will be treated as a word separator if it is not in braces
    or quotes.

\\\\

:   Backslash

\\*ooo*

:   The digits *ooo* (one, two, or three of them) give a eight-bit
    octal value for the Unicode character that will be inserted, in
    the range *000*--*377* (i.e., the range U+000000--U+0000FF). The
    parser will stop just before this range overflows, or when the
    maximum of three digits is reached. The upper bits of the
    Unicode character will be 0.

\\**x***hh*

:   The hexadecimal digits *hh* (one or two of them) give an
    eight-bit hexadecimal value for the Unicode character that will
    be inserted. The upper bits of the Unicode character will be 0
    (i.e., the character will be in the range U+000000--U+0000FF).

\\**u***hhhh*

:   The hexadecimal digits *hhhh* (one, two, three, or four of them)
    give a sixteen-bit hexadecimal value for the Unicode character
    that will be inserted. The upper bits of the Unicode character
    will be 0 (i.e., the character will be in the range
    U+000000--U+00FFFF).

\\**U***hhhhhhhh*

:   The hexadecimal digits *hhhhhhhh* (one up to eight of them) give
    a twenty-one-bit hexadecimal value for the Unicode character
    that will be inserted, in the range U+000000--U+10FFFF. The
    parser will stop just before this range overflows, or when the
    maximum of eight digits is reached. The upper bits of the
    Unicode character will be 0.

    The range U+010000--U+10FFFD is reserved for the future.

Backslash substitution is not performed on words enclosed in braces,
except for backslash-newline as described above.
</code></pre></div>
<p>[10] Comments.</p>
<p>:   If a hash character appears at a point where Tcl is expecting the
    first character of the first word of a command, then the hash
    character and the characters that follow it, up through the next
    newline, are treated as a comment and ignored. The comment character
    only has significance when it appears at the beginning of a command.</p>
<p>[11] Order of substitution.</p>
<p>:   Each character is processed exactly once by the Tcl interpreter as
    part of creating the words of a command. For example, if variable
    substitution occurs then no further substitutions are performed on
    the value of the variable; the value is inserted into the word
    verbatim. If command substitution occurs then the nested command is
    processed entirely by the recursive call to the Tcl interpreter; no
    substitutions are performed before making the recursive call and no
    additional substitutions are performed on the result of the nested
    script.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Substitutions take place from left to right, and each substitution
is evaluated completely before attempting to evaluate the next.
Thus, a sequence like

    set y [set x 0][incr x][incr x]

will always set the variable *y* to the value, *012*.
</code></pre></div>
<p>[12] Substitution and word boundaries.</p>
<p>:   Substitutions do not affect the word boundaries of a command, except
    for argument expansion as specified in rule [5]. For example,
    during variable substitution the entire value of the variable
    becomes part of a single word, even if the variable\'s value
    contains spaces.</p>
