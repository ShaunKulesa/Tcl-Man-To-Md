<p>transchan - command handler API of channel transforms</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>cmdPrefix </strong><em>option</em> ?<em>arg arg ...</em>?</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The Tcl-level handler for a channel transformation has to be a command
with subcommands (termed an <em>ensemble</em> despite not implying that it must
be created with <strong>namespace ensemble create</strong>; this mechanism is not
tied to <strong>namespace ensemble</strong> in any way). Note that <em>cmdPrefix</em> is
whatever was specified in the call to <strong>chan push</strong>, and may consist of
multiple arguments; this will be expanded to multiple words in place of
the prefix.</p>
<p>Of all the possible subcommands, the handler <em>must</em> support
<strong>initialize</strong> and <strong>finalize</strong>. Transformations for writable channels
must also support <strong>write</strong>, and transformations for readable channels
must also support <strong>read</strong>.</p>
<p>Note that in the descriptions below <em>cmdPrefix</em> may be more than one
word, and <em>handle</em> is the value returned by the <strong>chan push</strong> call used
to create the transformation.</p>
<h2 id="generic-subcommands">GENERIC SUBCOMMANDS</h2>
<p>The following subcommands are relevant to all types of channel.</p>
<p><em>cmdPrefix </em><strong>clear </strong><em>handle</em></p>
<p>:   This optional subcommand is called to signify to the transformation
    that any data stored in internal buffers (either incoming or
    outgoing) must be cleared. It is called when a <strong>chan seek</strong> is
    performed on the channel being transformed.</p>
<p><em>cmdPrefix </em><strong>finalize </strong><em>handle</em></p>
<p>:   This mandatory subcommand is called last for the given <em>handle</em>, and
    then never again, and it exists to allow for cleaning up any
    Tcl-level data structures associated with the transformation.
    <em>Warning!</em> Any errors thrown by this subcommand will be ignored. It
    is not guaranteed to be called if the interpreter is deleted.</p>
<p><em>cmdPrefix </em><strong>initialize </strong><em>handle mode</em></p>
<p>:   This mandatory subcommand is called first, and then never again (for
    the given <em>handle</em>). Its responsibility is to initialize all parts
    of the transformation at the Tcl level. The <em>mode</em> is a list
    containing any of <strong>read </strong>and <strong>write</strong>.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>**write**

:   implies that the channel is writable.

**read**

:   implies that the channel is readable.

The return value of the subcommand should be a list containing the
names of all subcommands supported by this handler. Any error thrown
by the subcommand will prevent the creation of the transformation.
The thrown error will appear as error thrown by **chan push**.
</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="read-related-subcommands">READ-RELATED SUBCOMMANDS</h2>
<p>These subcommands are used for handling transformations applied to
readable channels; though strictly <strong>read </strong>is optional, it must be
supported if any of the others is or the channel will be made
non-readable.</p>
<p><em>cmdPrefix </em><strong>drain </strong><em>handle</em></p>
<p>:   This optional subcommand is called whenever data in the
    transformation input (i.e. read) buffer has to be forced upward,
    i.e. towards the user or script. The result returned by the method
    is taken as the <em>binary</em> data to push upward to the level above this
    transformation (the reader or a higher-level transformation).</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>In other words, when this method is called the transformation cannot
defer the actual transformation operation anymore and has to
transform all data waiting in its internal read buffers and return
the result of that action.
</code></pre></div>
<p><em>cmdPrefix </em><strong>limit? </strong><em>handle</em></p>
<p>:   This optional subcommand is called to allow the Tcl I/O engine to
    determine how far ahead it should read. If present, it should return
    an integer number greater than zero which indicates how many bytes
    ahead should be read, or an integer less than zero to indicate that
    the I/O engine may read as far ahead as it likes.</p>
<p><em>cmdPrefix </em><strong>read </strong><em>handle buffer</em></p>
<p>:   This subcommand, which must be present if the transformation is to
    work with readable channels, is called whenever the base channel, or
    a transformation below this transformation, pushes data upward. The
    <em>buffer</em> contains the binary data which has been given to us from
    below. It is the responsibility of this subcommand to actually
    transform the data. The result returned by the subcommand is taken
    as the binary data to push further upward to the transformation
    above this transformation. This can also be the user or script that
    originally read from the channel.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Note that the result is allowed to be empty, or even less than the
data we received; the transformation is not required to transform
everything given to it right now. It is allowed to store incoming
data in internal buffers and to defer the actual transformation
until it has more data.
</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="write-related-subcommands">WRITE-RELATED SUBCOMMANDS</h2>
<p>These subcommands are used for handling transformations applied to
writable channels; though strictly <strong>write</strong> is optional, it must be
supported if any of the others is or the channel will be made
non-writable.</p>
<p><em>cmdPrefix </em><strong>flush </strong><em>handle</em></p>
<p>:   This optional subcommand is called whenever data in the
    transformation \'write\' buffer has to be forced downward, i.e.
    towards the base channel. The result returned by the subcommand is
    taken as the binary data to write to the transformation below the
    current transformation. This can be the base channel as well.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>In other words, when this subcommand is called the transformation
cannot defer the actual transformation operation anymore and has to
transform all data waiting in its internal write buffers and return
the result of that action.
</code></pre></div>
<p><em>cmdPrefix </em><strong>write </strong><em>handle buffer</em></p>
<p>:   This subcommand, which must be present if the transformation is to
    work with writable channels, is called whenever the user, or a
    transformation above this transformation, writes data downward. The
    <em>buffer</em> contains the binary data which has been written to us. It
    is the responsibility of this subcommand to actually transform the
    data.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>The result returned by the subcommand is taken as the binary data to
write to the transformation below this transformation. This can be
the base channel as well. Note that the result is allowed to be
empty, or less than the data we got; the transformation is not
required to transform everything which was written to it right now.
It is allowed to store this data in internal buffers and to defer
the actual transformation until it has more data.
