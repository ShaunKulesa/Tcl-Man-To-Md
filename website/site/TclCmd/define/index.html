<p>oo::define, oo::objdefine - define and configure classes and objects</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>package require TclOO</p>
<p><strong>oo::define</strong><em> class defScript</em> <strong>oo::define</strong><em> class subcommand arg</em>
?<em>arg ...</em>? <strong>oo::objdefine</strong><em> object defScript</em> <strong>oo::objdefine</strong><em>
object subcommand arg</em> ?<em>arg ...</em>?</p>
<p>\</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>oo::define</strong> command is used to control the configuration of
classes, and the <strong>oo::objdefine</strong> command is used to control the
configuration of objects (including classes as instance objects), with
the configuration being applied to the entity named in the <em>class</em> or
the <em>object</em> argument. Configuring a class also updates the
configuration of all subclasses of the class and all objects that are
instances of that class or which mix it in (as modified by any
per-instance configuration). The way in which the configuration is done
is controlled by either the <em>defScript</em> argument or by the <em>subcommand</em>
and following <em>arg</em> arguments; when the second is present, it is exactly
as if all the arguments from <em>subcommand</em> onwards are made into a list
and that list is used as the <em>defScript</em> argument.</p>
<h2 id="configuring-classes">CONFIGURING CLASSES</h2>
<p>The following commands are supported in the <em>defScript</em> for
<strong>oo::define</strong>, each of which may also be used in the <em>subcommand</em> form:</p>
<p><strong>constructor</strong><em> argList bodyScript</em></p>
<p>:   This creates or updates the constructor for a class. The formal
    arguments to the constructor (defined using the same format as for
    the Tcl <strong>proc</strong> command) will be <em>argList</em>, and the body of the
    constructor will be <em>bodyScript</em>. When the body of the constructor
    is evaluated, the current namespace of the constructor will be a
    namespace that is unique to the object being constructed. Within the
    constructor, the <strong>next</strong> command should be used to call the
    superclasses\' constructors. If <em>bodyScript</em> is the empty string,
    the constructor will be deleted.</p>
<p><strong>deletemethod</strong><em> name</em> ?<em>name ...</em>?</p>
<p>:   This deletes each of the methods called <em>name</em> from a class. The
    methods must have previously existed in that class. Does not affect
    the superclasses of the class, nor does it affect the subclasses or
    instances of the class (except when they have a call chain through
    the class being modified) or the class object itself.</p>
<p><strong>destructor</strong><em> bodyScript</em></p>
<p>:   This creates or updates the destructor for a class. Destructors take
    no arguments, and the body of the destructor will be <em>bodyScript</em>.
    The destructor is called when objects of the class are deleted, and
    when called will have the object\'s unique namespace as the current
    namespace. Destructors should use the <strong>next</strong> command to call the
    superclasses\' destructors. Note that destructors are not called in
    all situations (e.g. if the interpreter is destroyed). If
    <em>bodyScript</em> is the empty string, the destructor will be deleted.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Note that errors during the evaluation of a destructor *are not
returned* to the code that causes the destruction of an object.
Instead, they are passed to the currently-defined **bgerror**
handler.
</code></pre></div>
<p><strong>export</strong><em> name </em>?<em>name ...</em>?</p>
<p>:   This arranges for each of the named methods, <em>name</em>, to be exported
    (i.e. usable outside an instance through the instance object\'s
    command) by the class being defined. Note that the methods
    themselves may be actually defined by a superclass; subclass exports
    override superclass visibility, and may in turn be overridden by
    instances.</p>
<p><strong>filter</strong> ?<em>-slotOperation</em>? ?<em>methodName ...</em>?</p>
<p>:   </p>
<p>This slot (see <strong>SLOTTED DEFINITIONS</strong> below)</p>
<p>sets or updates the list of method names that are used to guard whether
method call to instances of the class may be called and what the
method\'s results are. Each <em>methodName</em> names a single filtering method
(which may be exposed or not exposed); it is not an error for a
non-existent method to be named since they may be defined by subclasses.</p>
<p>By default, this slot works by appending.</p>
<p><strong>forward</strong><em> name cmdName </em>?<em>arg ...</em>?</p>
<p>:   This creates or updates a forwarded method called <em>name</em>. The method
    is defined be forwarded to the command called <em>cmdName</em>, with
    additional arguments, <em>arg</em> etc., added before those arguments
    specified by the caller of the method. The <em>cmdName</em> will always be
    resolved using the rules of the invoking objects\' namespaces, i.e.,
    when <em>cmdName</em> is not fully-qualified, the command will be searched
    for in each object\'s namespace, using the instances\' namespace\'s
    path, or by looking in the global namespace. The method will be
    exported if <em>name</em> starts with a lower-case letter, and non-exported
    otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>method</strong><em> name argList bodyScript</em></p>
<p>:   This creates or updates a method that is implemented as a
    procedure-like script. The name of the method is <em>name</em>, the formal
    arguments to the method (defined using the same format as for the
    Tcl <strong>proc</strong> command) will be <em>argList</em>, and the body of the method
    will be <em>bodyScript</em>. When the body of the method is evaluated, the
    current namespace of the method will be a namespace that is unique
    to the current object. The method will be exported if <em>name</em> starts
    with a lower-case letter, and non-exported otherwise; this behavior
    can be overridden via <strong>export</strong> and <strong>unexport</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>mixin</strong> ?<em>-slotOperation</em>? ?<em>className ...</em>?</p>
<p>:   </p>
<p>This slot (see <strong>SLOTTED DEFINITIONS</strong> below)</p>
<p>sets or updates the list of additional classes that are to be mixed into
all the instances of the class being defined. Each <em>className</em> argument
names a single class that is to be mixed in.</p>
<p>By default, this slot works by replacement.</p>
<p><strong>renamemethod</strong><em> fromName toName</em></p>
<p>:   This renames the method called <em>fromName</em> in a class to <em>toName</em>.
    The method must have previously existed in the class, and <em>toName</em>
    must not previously refer to a method in that class. Does not affect
    the superclasses of the class, nor does it affect the subclasses or
    instances of the class (except when they have a call chain through
    the class being modified), or the class object itself. Does not
    change the export status of the method; if it was exported before,
    it will be afterwards.</p>
<p><strong>self</strong><em> subcommand arg ...</em></p>
<p>:   </p>
<p><strong>self</strong><em> script</em></p>
<p>:   This command is equivalent to calling <strong>oo::objdefine</strong> on the class
    being defined (see <strong>CONFIGURING OBJECTS</strong> below for a description
    of the supported values of <em>subcommand</em>). It follows the same
    general pattern of argument handling as the <strong>oo::define</strong> and
    <strong>oo::objdefine</strong> commands, and operates identically to</p>
<p><strong>superclass</strong> ?<em>-slotOperation</em>? ?<em>className ...</em>?</p>
<p>:   </p>
<p>This slot (see <strong>SLOTTED DEFINITIONS</strong> below)</p>
<p>allows the alteration of the superclasses of the class being defined.
Each <em>className</em> argument names one class that is to be a superclass of
the defined class. Note that objects must not be changed from being
classes to being non-classes or vice-versa, that an empty parent class
is equivalent to <strong>oo::object</strong>, and that the parent classes of
<strong>oo::object</strong> and <strong>oo::class</strong> may not be modified.</p>
<p>By default, this slot works by replacement.</p>
<p><strong>unexport</strong><em> name </em>?<em>name ...</em>?</p>
<p>:   This arranges for each of the named methods, <em>name</em>, to be not
    exported (i.e. not usable outside the instance through the instance
    object\'s command, but instead just through the <strong>my</strong> command
    visible in each object\'s context) by the class being defined. Note
    that the methods themselves may be actually defined by a superclass;
    subclass unexports override superclass visibility, and may be
    overridden by instance unexports.</p>
<p><strong>variable</strong> ?<em>-slotOperation</em>? ?<em>name ...</em>?</p>
<p>:   </p>
<p>This slot (see <strong>SLOTTED DEFINITIONS</strong> below) arranges for each of the
named variables to be automatically made available in the methods,
constructor and destructor declared by the class being defined. Each
variable name must not have any namespace separators and must not look
like an array access. All variables will be actually present in the
instance object on which the method is executed. Note that the variable
lists declared by a superclass or subclass are completely disjoint, as
are variable lists declared by instances; the list of variable names is
just for methods (and constructors and destructors) declared by this
class. By default, this slot works by appending.</p>
<h2 id="configuring-objects">CONFIGURING OBJECTS</h2>
<p>The following commands are supported in the <em>defScript</em> for
<strong>oo::objdefine</strong>, each of which may also be used in the <em>subcommand</em>
form:</p>
<p><strong>class</strong><em> className</em></p>
<p>:   This allows the class of an object to be changed after creation.
    Note that the class\'s constructors are not called when this is
    done, and so the object may well be in an inconsistent state unless
    additional configuration work is done.</p>
<p><strong>deletemethod</strong><em> name</em> ?<em>name ...</em></p>
<p>:   This deletes each of the methods called <em>name</em> from an object. The
    methods must have previously existed in that object (e.g., because
    it was created through <strong>oo::objdefine method</strong>). Does not affect
    the classes that the object is an instance of, or remove the
    exposure of those class-provided methods in the instance of that
    class.</p>
<p><strong>export</strong><em> name </em>?<em>name ...</em>?</p>
<p>:   This arranges for each of the named methods, <em>name</em>, to be exported
    (i.e. usable outside the object through the object\'s command) by
    the object being defined. Note that the methods themselves may be
    actually defined by a class or superclass; object exports override
    class visibility.</p>
<p><strong>filter</strong> ?<em>-slotOperation</em>? ?<em>methodName ...</em>?</p>
<p>:   </p>
<p>This slot (see <strong>SLOTTED DEFINITIONS</strong> below)</p>
<p>sets or updates the list of method names that are used to guard whether
a method call to the object may be called and what the method\'s results
are. Each <em>methodName</em> names a single filtering method (which may be
exposed or not exposed); it is not an error for a non-existent method to
be named. Note that the actual list of filters also depends on the
filters set upon any classes that the object is an instance of.</p>
<p>By default, this slot works by appending.</p>
<p><strong>forward</strong><em> name cmdName </em>?<em>arg ...</em>?</p>
<p>:   This creates or updates a forwarded object method called <em>name</em>. The
    method is defined be forwarded to the command called <em>cmdName</em>, with
    additional arguments, <em>arg</em> etc., added before those arguments
    specified by the caller of the method. Forwarded methods should be
    deleted using the <strong>method</strong> subcommand. The method will be exported
    if <em>name</em> starts with a lower-case letter, and non-exported
    otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>method</strong><em> name argList bodyScript</em></p>
<p>:   This creates, updates or deletes an object method. The name of the
    method is <em>name</em>, the formal arguments to the method (defined using
    the same format as for the Tcl <strong>proc</strong> command) will be <em>argList</em>,
    and the body of the method will be <em>bodyScript</em>. When the body of
    the method is evaluated, the current namespace of the method will be
    a namespace that is unique to the object. The method will be
    exported if <em>name</em> starts with a lower-case letter, and non-exported
    otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>mixin</strong> ?<em>-slotOperation</em>? ?<em>className ...</em>?</p>
<p>:   </p>
<p>This slot (see <strong>SLOTTED DEFINITIONS</strong> below)</p>
<p>sets or updates a per-object list of additional classes that are to be
mixed into the object. Each argument, <em>className</em>, names a single class
that is to be mixed in.</p>
<p>By default, this slot works by replacement.</p>
<p><strong>renamemethod</strong><em> fromName toName</em></p>
<p>:   This renames the method called <em>fromName</em> in an object to <em>toName</em>.
    The method must have previously existed in the object, and <em>toName</em>
    must not previously refer to a method in that object. Does not
    affect the classes that the object is an instance of and cannot
    rename in an instance object the methods provided by those classes
    (though a <strong>oo::objdefine forward</strong>ed method may provide an
    equivalent capability). Does not change the export status of the
    method; if it was exported before, it will be afterwards.</p>
<p><strong>unexport</strong><em> name </em>?<em>name ...</em>?</p>
<p>:   This arranges for each of the named methods, <em>name</em>, to be not
    exported (i.e. not usable outside the object through the object\'s
    command, but instead just through the <strong>my</strong> command visible in the
    object\'s context) by the object being defined. Note that the
    methods themselves may be actually defined by a class; instance
    unexports override class visibility.</p>
<p><strong>variable</strong> ?<em>-slotOperation</em>? ?<em>name ...</em>?</p>
<p>:   </p>
<p>This slot (see <strong>SLOTTED DEFINITIONS</strong> below) arranges for each of the
named variables to be automatically made available in the methods
declared by the object being defined. Each variable name must not have
any namespace separators and must not look like an array access. All
variables will be actually present in the object on which the method is
executed. Note that the variable lists declared by the classes and
mixins of which the object is an instance are completely disjoint; the
list of variable names is just for methods declared by this object. By
default, this slot works by appending.</p>
<h1 id="slotted-definitions">SLOTTED DEFINITIONS</h1>
<p>Some of the configurable definitions of a class or object are <em>slotted</em>
definitions. This means that the configuration is implemented by a slot
object, that is an instance of the class <strong>oo::Slot</strong>, which manages a
list of values (class names, variable names, etc.) that comprises the
contents of the slot. The class defines three operations (as methods)
that may be done on the slot:</p>
<p><em>slot</em> <strong>-append</strong> ?<em>member ...</em>?</p>
<p>:   </p>
<p>This appends the given <em>member</em> elements to the slot definition.</p>
<p><em>slot</em> <strong>-clear</strong></p>
<p>:   </p>
<p>This sets the slot definition to the empty list.</p>
<p><em>slot</em> <strong>-set</strong> ?<em>member ...</em>?</p>
<p>:   </p>
<p>This replaces the slot definition with the given <em>member</em> elements.</p>
<p>A consequence of this is that any use of a slot\'s default operation
where the first member argument begins with a hyphen will be an error.
One of the above operations should be used explicitly in those
circumstances.</p>
<h2 id="slot-implementation">SLOT IMPLEMENTATION</h2>
<p>Internally, slot objects also define a method <strong>--default-operation</strong>
which is forwarded to the default operation of the slot (thus, for the
class slot, this is forwarded to and these methods which provide the
implementation interface:</p>
<p><em>slot</em> <strong>Get</strong></p>
<p>:   </p>
<p>Returns a list that is the current contents of the slot. This method
must always be called from a stack frame created by a call to
<strong>oo::define</strong> or <strong>oo::objdefine</strong>.</p>
<p><em>slot</em> <strong>Set </strong><em>elementList</em></p>
<p>:   </p>
<p>Sets the contents of the slot to the list <em>elementList</em> and returns the
empty string. This method must always be called from a stack frame
created by a call to <strong>oo::define</strong> or <strong>oo::objdefine</strong>.</p>
<p>The implementation of these methods is slot-dependent (and responsible
for accessing the correct part of the class or object definition). Slots
also have an unknown method handler to tie all these pieces together,
and they hide their <strong>destroy</strong> method so that it is not invoked
inadvertently. It is <em>recommended</em> that any user changes to the slot
mechanism be restricted to defining new operations whose names start
with a hyphen.</p>
<h1 id="examples">EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>This example demonstrates how to use both forms of the <strong>oo::define</strong>
and <strong>oo::objdefine</strong> commands (they work in the same way), as well as
illustrating four of the subcommands of them.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>oo::class create c
c create o
oo::define c method foo {} {
    puts &quot;world&quot;
}
oo::objdefine o {
    method bar {} {
        my Foo &quot;hello &quot;
        my foo
    }
    forward Foo ::puts -nonewline
    unexport foo
}
o bar                → prints &quot;hello world&quot;
o foo                → error &quot;unknown method foo&quot;
o Foo Bar            → error &quot;unknown method Foo&quot;
oo::objdefine o renamemethod bar lollipop
o lollipop           → prints &quot;hello world&quot;
</code></pre></div>
<p>This example shows how additional classes can be mixed into an object.
It also shows how <strong>mixin</strong> is a slot that supports appending:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>oo::object create inst
inst m1              → error &quot;unknown method m1&quot;
inst m2              → error &quot;unknown method m2&quot;

oo::class create A {
    method m1 {} {
        puts &quot;red brick&quot;
    }
}
oo::objdefine inst {
    mixin A
}
inst m1              → prints &quot;red brick&quot;
inst m2              → error &quot;unknown method m2&quot;

oo::class create B {
    method m2 {} {
        puts &quot;blue brick&quot;
    }
}
oo::objdefine inst {
    mixin -append B
}
inst m1              → prints &quot;red brick&quot;
inst m2              → prints &quot;blue brick&quot;
</code></pre></div>
