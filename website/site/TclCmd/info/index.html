<h1 id="name">NAME</h1>
<p>info - Return information about the state of the Tcl interpreter</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>info </strong><em>option </em>?<em>arg arg ...</em>?</p>
<p>\</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This command provides information about various internals of the Tcl
interpreter. The legal <em>option</em>s (which may be abbreviated) are:</p>
<p><strong>info args </strong><em>procname</em></p>
<p>:   Returns a list containing the names of the arguments to procedure
    <em>procname</em>, in order. <em>Procname</em> must be the name of a Tcl command
    procedure.</p>
<p><strong>info body </strong><em>procname</em></p>
<p>:   Returns the body of procedure <em>procname</em>. <em>Procname</em> must be the
    name of a Tcl command procedure.</p>
<p><strong>info class</strong><em> subcommand class</em> ?<em>arg ...</em></p>
<p>:   </p>
<p>Returns information about the class, <em>class</em>. The <em>subcommand</em>s are
described in <strong>CLASS INTROSPECTION</strong> below.</p>
<p><strong>info cmdcount</strong></p>
<p>:   Returns a count of the total number of commands that have been
    invoked in this interpreter.</p>
<p><strong>info commands </strong>?<em>pattern</em>?</p>
<p>:   If <em>pattern</em> is not specified, returns a list of names of all the
    Tcl commands visible (i.e. executable without using a qualified
    name) to the current namespace, including both the built-in commands
    written in C and the command procedures defined using the <strong>proc</strong>
    command. If <em>pattern</em> is specified, only those names matching
    <em>pattern</em> are returned. Matching is determined using the same rules
    as for <strong>string match</strong>. <em>pattern</em> can be a qualified name like
    <strong>Foo::print*</strong>. That is, it may specify a particular namespace
    using a sequence of namespace names separated by double colons
    (<strong>::</strong>), and may have pattern matching special characters at the
    end to specify a set of commands in that namespace. If <em>pattern</em> is
    a qualified name, the resulting list of command names has each one
    qualified with the name of the specified namespace, and only the
    commands defined in the named namespace are returned.</p>
<p><strong>info complete </strong><em>command</em></p>
<p>:   Returns 1 if <em>command</em> is a complete Tcl command in the sense of
    having no unclosed quotes, braces, brackets or array element names.
    If the command does not appear to be complete then 0 is returned.
    This command is typically used in line-oriented input environments
    to allow users to type in commands that span multiple lines; if the
    command is not complete, the script can delay evaluating it until
    additional lines have been typed to complete the command.</p>
<p><strong>info coroutine</strong></p>
<p>:   </p>
<p>Returns the name of the currently executing <strong>coroutine</strong>, or the empty
string if either no coroutine is currently executing, or the current
coroutine has been deleted (but has not yet returned or yielded since
deletion).</p>
<p><strong>info default </strong><em>procname arg varname</em></p>
<p>:   <em>Procname</em> must be the name of a Tcl command procedure and <em>arg</em>
    must be the name of an argument to that procedure. If <em>arg</em> does not
    have a default value then the command returns <strong>0</strong>. Otherwise it
    returns <strong>1</strong> and places the default value of <em>arg</em> into variable
    <em>varname</em>.</p>
<p><strong>info errorstack </strong>?<em>interp</em>?</p>
<p>:   </p>
<p>Returns, in a form that is programmatically easy to parse, the function
names and arguments at each level from the call stack of the last error
in the given <em>interp</em>, or in the current one if not specified.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This form is an even-sized list alternating tokens and parameters.
Tokens are currently either <strong>CALL</strong>, <strong>UP</strong>, or <strong>INNER</strong>, but other
values may be introduced in the future. <strong>CALL</strong> indicates a procedure
call, and its parameter is the corresponding <strong>info level</strong> <strong>0</strong>.
<strong>UP</strong> indicates a shift in variable frames generated by <strong>uplevel</strong>
or similar, and applies to the previous <strong>CALL</strong> item. Its parameter
is the level offset. <strong>INNER</strong> identifies the which is the innermost
atomic command or bytecode instruction that raised the error, along
with its arguments when available. While <strong>CALL</strong> and <strong>UP</strong> allow to
follow complex call paths, <strong>INNER</strong> homes in on the offending
operation in the innermost procedure call, even going to
sub-expression granularity.</p>
<p>This information is also present in the <strong>-errorstack</strong> entry of the
options dictionary returned by 3-argument <strong>catch</strong>; <strong>info
errorstack</strong> is a convenient way of retrieving it for uncaught errors
at top-level in an interactive <strong>tclsh</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>info exists </strong><em>varName</em></p>
<p>:   Returns <strong>1</strong> if the variable named <em>varName</em> exists in the current
    context (either as a global or local variable) and has been defined
    by being given a value, returns <strong>0</strong> otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>info frame</strong> ?<em>number</em>?</p>
<p>:   This command provides access to all frames on the stack, even those
    hidden from <strong>info level</strong>. If <em>number</em> is not specified, this
    command returns a number giving the frame level of the command. This
    is 1 if the command is invoked at top-level. If <em>number</em> is
    specified, then the result is a dictionary containing the location
    information for the command at the <em>number</em>ed level on the stack.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>If *number* is positive (\&gt; 0) then it selects a particular stack
level (1 refers to the outer-most active command, 2 to the command
it called, and so on, up to the current frame level which refers to
**info frame** itself); otherwise it gives a level relative to the
current command (0 refers to the current command, i.e., **info**
frame itself, -1 to its caller, and so on).

This is similar to how **info level** works, except that this
subcommand reports all frames, like **source**d scripts, **eval**s,
**uplevel**s, etc.

Note that for nested commands, like only will be seen by an **info
frame** invoked within This is the same as for **info level** and
error stack traces.

The result dictionary may contain the keys listed below, with the
specified meanings for their values:

**type**

:   This entry is always present and describes the nature of the
    location for the command. The recognized values are **source**,
    **proc**, **eval**, and **precompiled**.

    **source**

    :   means that the command is found in a script loaded by the
        **source** command.

    **proc**

    :   means that the command is found in dynamically created
        procedure body.

    **eval**

    :   means that the command is executed by **eval** or
        **uplevel**.

    **precompiled**

    :   means that the command is found in a pre-compiled script
        (loadable by the package **tbcload**), and no further
        information will be available.

**line**

:   This entry provides the number of the line the command is at
    inside of the script it is a part of. This information is not
    present for type **precompiled**. For type **source** this
    information is counted relative to the beginning of the file,
    whereas for the last two types the line is counted relative to
    the start of the script.

**file**

:   This entry is present only for type **source**. It provides the
    normalized path of the file the command is in.

**cmd**

:   This entry provides the string representation of the command.
    This is usually the unsubstituted form, however for commands
    which are a canonically-constructed list (e.g., as produced by
    the **list** command) executed by **eval** it is the substituted
    form as they have no other string representation. Care is taken
    that the canonicality property of the latter is not spoiled.

**proc**

:   This entry is present only if the command is found in the body
    of a regular Tcl procedure. It then provides the name of that
    procedure.

**lambda**

:   This entry is present only if the command is found in the body
    of an anonymous Tcl procedure, i.e. a lambda. It then provides
    the entire definition of the lambda in question.

**level**

:   This entry is present only if the queried frame has a
    corresponding frame returned by **info level**. It provides the
    index of this frame, relative to the current level (0 and
    negative numbers).

A thing of note is that for procedures statically defined in files
the locations of commands in their bodies will be reported with type
**source** and absolute line numbers, and not as type **proc**. The
same is true for procedures nested in statically defined procedures,
and literal eval scripts in files or statically defined procedures.

In contrast, procedure definitions and **eval** within a dynamically
**eval**uated environment count line numbers relative to the start
of their script, even if they would be able to count relative to the
start of the outer dynamic script. That type of number usually makes
more sense.

A different way of describing this behaviour is that file based
locations are tracked as deeply as possible, and where this is not
possible the lines are counted based on the smallest possible
**eval** or procedure body, as that scope is usually easier to find
than any dynamic outer scope.

The syntactic form **{\*}** is handled like **eval**. I.e. if it is
given a literal list argument the system tracks the line number
within the list words as well, and otherwise all line numbers are
counted relative to the start of each word (smallest scope)

<p><strong>info functions </strong>?<em>pattern</em>?</p>
<p>:   If <em>pattern</em> is not specified, returns a list of all the math
    functions currently defined. If <em>pattern</em> is specified, only those
    functions whose name matches <em>pattern</em> are returned. Matching is
    determined using the same rules as for <strong>string match</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>info globals </strong>?<em>pattern</em>?</p>
<p>:   If <em>pattern</em> is not specified, returns a list of all the names of
    currently-defined global variables. Global variables are variables
    in the global namespace. If <em>pattern</em> is specified, only those names
    matching <em>pattern</em> are returned. Matching is determined using the
    same rules as for <strong>string match</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>info hostname</strong></p>
<p>:   Returns the name of the computer on which this invocation is being
    executed. Note that this name is not guaranteed to be the fully
    qualified domain name of the host. Where machines have several
    different names (as is common on systems with both TCP/IP (DNS) and
    NetBIOS-based networking installed,) it is the name that is suitable
    for TCP/IP networking that is returned.</p>
<p><strong>info level</strong> ?<em>number</em>?</p>
<p>:   If <em>number</em> is not specified, this command returns a number giving
    the stack level of the invoking procedure, or 0 if the command is
    invoked at top-level. If <em>number</em> is specified, then the result is a
    list consisting of the name and arguments for the procedure call at
    level <em>number</em> on the stack. If <em>number</em> is positive then it selects
    a particular stack level (1 refers to the top-most active procedure,
    2 to the procedure it called, and so on); otherwise it gives a level
    relative to the current level (0 refers to the current procedure, -1
    to its caller, and so on). See the <strong>uplevel</strong> command for more
    information on what stack levels mean.</p>
<p><strong>info library</strong></p>
<p>:   Returns the name of the library directory in which standard Tcl
    scripts are stored. This is actually the value of the
    <strong>tcl_library</strong> variable and may be changed by setting
    <strong>tcl_library</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>info loaded </strong>?<em>interp</em>?</p>
<p>:   Returns a list describing all of the packages that have been loaded
    into <em>interp</em> with the <strong>load</strong> command. Each list element is a
    sub-list with two elements consisting of the name of the file from
    which the package was loaded and the name of the package. For
    statically-loaded packages the file name will be an empty string. If
    <em>interp</em> is omitted then information is returned for all packages
    loaded in any interpreter in the process. To get a list of just the
    packages in the current interpreter, specify an empty string for the
    <em>interp</em> argument.</p>
<p><strong>info locals </strong>?<em>pattern</em>?</p>
<p>:   If <em>pattern</em> is not specified, returns a list of all the names of
    currently-defined local variables, including arguments to the
    current procedure, if any. Variables defined with the <strong>global</strong>,
    <strong>upvar</strong> and <strong>variable</strong> commands will not be returned. If
    <em>pattern</em> is specified, only those names matching <em>pattern</em> are
    returned. Matching is determined using the same rules as for
    <strong>string match</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>info nameofexecutable</strong></p>
<p>:   Returns the full path name of the binary file from which the
    application was invoked. If Tcl was unable to identify the file,
    then an empty string is returned.</p>
<p><strong>info object</strong><em> subcommand object</em> ?<em>arg ...</em></p>
<p>:   </p>
<p>Returns information about the object, <em>object</em>. The <em>subcommand</em>s are
described in <strong>OBJECT INTROSPECTION</strong> below.</p>
<p><strong>info patchlevel</strong></p>
<p>:   Returns the value of the global variable <strong>tcl_patchLevel</strong>, which
    holds the exact version of the Tcl library by default.</p>
<p><strong>info procs </strong>?<em>pattern</em>?</p>
<p>:   If <em>pattern</em> is not specified, returns a list of all the names of
    Tcl command procedures in the current namespace. If <em>pattern</em> is
    specified, only those procedure names in the current namespace
    matching <em>pattern</em> are returned. Matching is determined using the
    same rules as for <strong>string match</strong>. If <em>pattern</em> contains any
    namespace separators, they are used to select a namespace relative
    to the current namespace (or relative to the global namespace if
    <em>pattern</em> starts with <strong>::</strong>) to match within; the matching pattern
    is taken to be the part after the last namespace separator.</p>
<p><strong>info script</strong> ?<em>filename</em>?</p>
<p>:   If a Tcl script file is currently being evaluated (i.e. there is a
    call to <strong>Tcl_EvalFile</strong> active or there is an active invocation of
    the <strong>source</strong> command), then this command returns the name of the
    innermost file being processed. If <em>filename</em> is specified, then the
    return value of this command will be modified for the duration of
    the active invocation to return that name. This is useful in virtual
    file system applications. Otherwise the command returns an empty
    string.</p>
<p><strong>info sharedlibextension</strong></p>
<p>:   Returns the extension used on this platform for the names of files
    containing shared libraries (for example, <strong>.so</strong> under Solaris). If
    shared libraries are not supported on this platform then an empty
    string is returned.</p>
<p><strong>info tclversion</strong></p>
<p>:   Returns the value of the global variable <strong>tcl_version</strong>, which
    holds the major and minor version of the Tcl library by default.</p>
<p><strong>info vars</strong> ?<em>pattern</em>?</p>
<p>:   If <em>pattern</em> is not specified, returns a list of all the names of
    currently-visible variables. This includes locals and
    currently-visible globals. If <em>pattern</em> is specified, only those
    names matching <em>pattern</em> are returned. Matching is determined using
    the same rules as for <strong>string match</strong>. <em>pattern</em> can be a qualified
    name like <strong>Foo::option*</strong>. That is, it may specify a particular
    namespace using a sequence of namespace names separated by double
    colons (<strong>::</strong>), and may have pattern matching special characters at
    the end to specify a set of variables in that namespace. If
    <em>pattern</em> is a qualified name, the resulting list of variable names
    has each matching namespace variable qualified with the name of its
    namespace. Note that a currently-visible variable may not yet if it
    has not been set (e.g. a variable declared but not set by
    <strong>variable</strong>).</p>

<p><strong>info object isa</strong><em> category object</em> ?<em>arg</em>?</p>
<p>:   </p>
<p>This subcommand tests whether an object belongs to a particular
category, returning a boolean value that indicates whether the <em>object</em>
argument meets the criteria for the category. The supported categories
are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>info object isa class</strong><em> object</em></p>
<p>:   </p>
<p>This returns whether <em>object</em> is a class (i.e. an instance of
<strong>oo::class</strong> or one of its subclasses).</p>
<p><strong>info object isa metaclass</strong><em> object</em></p>
<p>:   </p>
<p>This returns whether <em>object</em> is a class that can manufacture classes
(i.e. is <strong>oo::class</strong> or a subclass of it).</p>
<p><strong>info object isa mixin</strong><em> object class</em></p>
<p>:   </p>
<p>This returns whether <em>class</em> is directly mixed into <em>object</em>.</p>
<p><strong>info object isa object</strong><em> object</em></p>
<p>:   </p>
<p>This returns whether <em>object</em> really is an object.</p>
<p><strong>info object isa typeof</strong><em> object class</em></p>
<p>:   </p>
<p>This returns whether <em>class</em> is the type of <em>object</em> (i.e. whether
<em>object</em> is an instance of <em>class</em> or one of its subclasses, whether
direct or indirect).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>info object methods</strong><em> object</em> ?<em>option...</em>?</p>
<p>:   </p>
<p>This subcommand returns a list of all public (i.e. exported) methods of
the object called <em>object</em>. Any of the following <em>option</em>s may be
specified, controlling exactly which method names are returned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>-all</strong></p>
<p>:   </p>
<p>If the <strong>-all</strong> flag is given, the list of methods will include those
methods defined not just by the object, but also by the object\'s
class and mixins, plus the superclasses of those classes.</p>
<p><strong>-private</strong></p>
<p>:   </p>
<p>If the <strong>-private</strong> flag is given, the list of methods will also
include the private (i.e. non-exported) methods of the object (and
classes, if <strong>-all</strong> is also given).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>info object methodtype</strong><em> object method</em></p>
<p>:   </p>
<p>This subcommand returns a description of the type of implementation used
for the method named <em>method</em> of object <em>object</em>. When the result is
<strong>method</strong>, further information can be discovered with <strong>info object</strong>
definition, and when the result is <strong>forward</strong>, further information can
be discovered with <strong>info object forward</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>info object mixins</strong><em> object</em></p>
<p>:   </p>
<p>This subcommand returns a list of all classes that have been mixed into
the object named <em>object</em>.</p>
<p><strong>info object namespace</strong><em> object</em></p>
<p>:   </p>
<p>This subcommand returns the name of the internal namespace of the object
named <em>object</em>.</p>
<p><strong>info object variables</strong><em> object</em></p>
<p>:   </p>
<p>This subcommand returns a list of all variables that have been declared
for the object named <em>object</em> (i.e. that are automatically present in
the object\'s methods).</p>
<p><strong>info object vars</strong><em> object</em> ?<em>pattern</em>?</p>
<p>:   </p>
<p>This subcommand returns a list of all variables in the private namespace
of the object named <em>object</em>. If the optional <em>pattern</em> argument is
given, it is a filter (in the syntax of a <strong>string match</strong> glob pattern)
that constrains the list of variables returned. Note that this is
different from the list returned by <strong>info object variables</strong>; that can
include variables that are currently unset, whereas this can include
variables that are not automatically included by any of <em>object</em>\'s
methods (or those of its class, superclasses or mixins).</p>
<h1 id="examples">EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>This command prints out a procedure suitable for saving in a Tcl script:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>proc printProc {procName} {
    set result [list proc $procName]
    set formals {}
    foreach var [info args $procName] {
        if {[info default $procName $var def]} {
            lappend formals [list $var $def]
        } else {
            # Still need the list-quoting because variable
            # names may properly contain spaces.
            lappend formals [list $var]
        }
    }
    puts [lappend result $formals [info body $procName]]
}
</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="examples-with-objects">EXAMPLES WITH OBJECTS</h2>
<p>Every object necessarily knows what its class is; this information is
trivially extractable through introspection:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>oo::class create c
c create o
puts [info object class o]
                     → prints &quot;::c&quot;
puts [info object class c]
                     → prints &quot;::oo::class&quot;
</code></pre></div>
<p>The introspection capabilities can be used to discover what class
implements a method and get how it is defined. This procedure
illustrates how:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>proc getDef {obj method} {
    foreach inf [info object call $obj $method] {
        lassign $inf calltype name locus methodtype
        # Assume no forwards or filters, and hence no $calltype
        # or $methodtype checks...
        if {$locus eq &quot;object&quot;} {
            return [info object definition $obj $name]
        } else {
            return [info class definition $locus $name]
        }
    }
    error &quot;no definition for $method&quot;
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>This is an alternate way of looking up the definition; it is implemented
by manually scanning the list of methods up the inheritance tree. This
code assumes that only single inheritance is in use, and that there is
no complex use of mixed-in classes (in such cases, using <strong>info object
call</strong> as above is the simplest way of doing this by far):</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>proc getDef {obj method} {
    if {$method in [info object methods $obj]} {
        # Assume no forwards
        return [info object definition $obj $method]
    }
    set cls [info object class $obj]
    while {$method ni [info class methods $cls]} {
        # Assume the simple case
        set cls [lindex [info class superclass $cls] 0]
        if {$cls eq &quot;&quot;} {
            error &quot;no definition for $method&quot;
        }
    }
    # Assume no forwards
    return [info class definition $cls $method]
}
</code></pre></div>
