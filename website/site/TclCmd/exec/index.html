<p>exec - Invoke subprocesses</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>exec </strong>?<em>switches</em>? <em>arg </em>?<em>arg ...</em>? ?<strong>&amp;</strong>?</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This command treats its arguments as the specification of one or more
subprocesses to execute. The arguments take the form of a standard shell
pipeline where each <em>arg</em> becomes one word of a command, and each
distinct command becomes a subprocess. The result of the command is the
standard output of the final subprocess in the pipeline, interpreted
using the system <strong>encoding</strong>; to use any other encoding (especially
including binary data), the pipeline must be <strong>open</strong>ed, configured and
read explicitly.</p>
<p>If the initial arguments to <strong>exec</strong> start with <strong>-</strong> then they are
treated as command-line switches and are not part of the pipeline
specification. The following switches are currently supported:</p>
<p><strong>-ignorestderr</strong></p>
<p>:   Stops the <strong>exec</strong> command from treating the output of messages to
    the pipeline\'s standard error channel as an error case.</p>
<p><strong>-keepnewline</strong></p>
<p>:   Retains a trailing newline in the pipeline\'s output. Normally a
    trailing newline will be deleted.</p>
<p><strong>- -</strong></p>
<p>:   Marks the end of switches. The argument following this one will be
    treated as the first <em>arg</em> even if it starts with a <strong>-</strong>.</p>
<p>If an <em>arg</em> (or pair of <em>arg</em>s) has one of the forms described below
then it is used by <strong>exec</strong> to control the flow of input and output
among the subprocess(es). Such arguments will not be passed to the
subprocess(es). In forms such as <em>fileName</em> may either be in a separate
argument from or in the same argument with no intervening space (i.e.</p>
<p><strong>|</strong></p>
<p>:   Separates distinct commands in the pipeline. The standard output of
    the preceding command will be piped into the standard input of the
    next command.</p>
<p><strong>|&amp;</strong></p>
<p>:   Separates distinct commands in the pipeline. Both standard output
    and standard error of the preceding command will be piped into the
    standard input of the next command. This form of redirection
    overrides forms such as 2> and >&amp;.</p>
<p><strong>\&lt; </strong><em>fileName</em></p>
<p>:   The file named by <em>fileName</em> is opened and used as the standard
    input for the first command in the pipeline.</p>
<p><strong>\&lt;@ </strong><em>fileId</em></p>
<p>:   <em>FileId</em> must be the identifier for an open file, such as the return
    value from a previous call to <strong>open</strong>. It is used as the standard
    input for the first command in the pipeline. <em>FileId</em> must have been
    opened for reading.</p>
<p><strong>\&lt;\&lt; </strong><em>value</em></p>
<p>:   <em>Value</em> is passed to the first command as its standard input.</p>
<p><strong>> </strong><em>fileName</em></p>
<p>:   Standard output from the last command is redirected to the file
    named <em>fileName</em>, overwriting its previous contents.</p>
<p><strong>2> </strong><em>fileName</em></p>
<p>:   Standard error from all commands in the pipeline is redirected to
    the file named <em>fileName</em>, overwriting its previous contents.</p>
<p><strong>>&amp; </strong><em>fileName</em></p>
<p>:   Both standard output from the last command and standard error from
    all commands are redirected to the file named <em>fileName</em>,
    overwriting its previous contents.</p>
<p><strong>>> </strong><em>fileName</em></p>
<p>:   Standard output from the last command is redirected to the file
    named <em>fileName</em>, appending to it rather than overwriting it.</p>
<p><strong>2>> </strong><em>fileName</em></p>
<p>:   Standard error from all commands in the pipeline is redirected to
    the file named <em>fileName</em>, appending to it rather than overwriting
    it.</p>
<p><strong>>>&amp; </strong><em>fileName</em></p>
<p>:   Both standard output from the last command and standard error from
    all commands are redirected to the file named <em>fileName</em>, appending
    to it rather than overwriting it.</p>
<p><strong>>@ </strong><em>fileId</em></p>
<p>:   <em>FileId</em> must be the identifier for an open file, such as the return
    value from a previous call to <strong>open</strong>. Standard output from the
    last command is redirected to <em>fileId</em>\'s file, which must have been
    opened for writing.</p>
<p><strong>2>@ </strong><em>fileId</em></p>
<p>:   <em>FileId</em> must be the identifier for an open file, such as the return
    value from a previous call to <strong>open</strong>. Standard error from all
    commands in the pipeline is redirected to <em>fileId</em>\'s file. The file
    must have been opened for writing.</p>
<p><strong>2>@1 </strong></p>
<p>:   Standard error from all commands in the pipeline is redirected to
    the command result. This operator is only valid at the end of the
    command pipeline.</p>
<p><strong>>&amp;@ </strong><em>fileId</em></p>
<p>:   <em>FileId</em> must be the identifier for an open file, such as the return
    value from a previous call to <strong>open</strong>. Both standard output from
    the last command and standard error from all commands are redirected
    to <em>fileId</em>\'s file. The file must have been opened for writing.</p>
<p>If standard output has not been redirected then the <strong>exec</strong> command
returns the standard output from the last command in the pipeline,
unless was specified, in which case standard error is included as well.
If any of the commands in the pipeline exit abnormally or are killed or
suspended, then <strong>exec</strong> will return an error and the error message will
include the pipeline\'s output followed by error messages describing the
abnormal terminations; the <strong>-errorcode</strong> return option will contain
additional information about the last abnormal termination encountered.
If any of the commands writes to its standard error file and that
standard error is not redirected and <strong>-ignorestderr</strong> is not specified,
then <strong>exec</strong> will return an error; the error message will include the
pipeline\'s standard output, followed by messages about abnormal
terminations (if any), followed by the standard error output.</p>
<p>If the last character of the result or error message is a newline then
that character is normally deleted from the result or error message.
This is consistent with other Tcl return values, which do not normally
end with newlines. However, if <strong>-keepnewline</strong> is specified then the
trailing newline is retained.</p>
<p>If standard input is not redirected with or then the standard input for
the first command in the pipeline is taken from the application\'s
current standard input.</p>
<p>If the last <em>arg</em> is then the pipeline will be executed in background.
In this case the <strong>exec</strong> command will return a list whose elements are
the process identifiers for all of the subprocesses in the pipeline. The
standard output from the last command in the pipeline will go to the
application\'s standard output if it has not been redirected, and error
output from all of the commands in the pipeline will go to the
application\'s standard error file unless redirected.</p>
<p>The first word in each command is taken as the command name;
tilde-substitution is performed on it, and if the result contains no
slashes then the directories in the PATH environment variable are
searched for an executable by the given name. If the name contains a
slash then it must refer to an executable reachable from the current
directory. No expansion or other shell-like substitutions are performed
on the arguments to commands.</p>
<h1 id="portability-issues">PORTABILITY ISSUES</h1>
<p><strong>Windows</strong> (all versions)</p>
<p>:   Reading from or writing to a socket, using the notation, does not
    work. When reading from a socket, a 16-bit DOS application will hang
    and a 32-bit application will return immediately with end-of-file.
    When either type of application writes to a socket, the information
    is instead sent to the console, if one is present, or is discarded.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Note that the current escape resp. quoting of arguments for windows
works only with executables using CommandLineToArgv, CRT-library or
similar, as well as with the windows batch files (excepting the
newline, see below). Although it is the common escape algorithm,
but, in fact, the way how the executable parses the command-line
(resp. splits it into single arguments) is decisive.

Unfortunately, there is currently no way to supply newline character
within an argument to the batch files (**.cmd** or **.bat**) or to
the command processor (**cmd.exe /c**), because this causes
truncation of command-line (also the argument chain) on the first
newline character. But it works properly with an executable (using
CommandLineToArgv, etc).

The Tk console text widget does not provide real standard IO
capabilities. Under Tk, when redirecting from standard input, all
applications will see an immediate end-of-file; information
redirected to standard output or standard error will be discarded.

Either forward or backward slashes are accepted as path separators
for arguments to Tcl commands. When executing an application, the
path name specified for the application may also contain forward or
backward slashes as path separators. Bear in mind, however, that
most Windows applications accept arguments with forward slashes only
as option delimiters and backslashes only in paths. Any arguments to
an application that specify a path name with forward slashes will
not automatically be converted to use the backslash character. If an
argument contains forward slashes as the path separator, it may or
may not be recognized as a path name, depending on the program.

Two or more forward or backward slashes in a row in a path refer to
a network path. For example, a simple concatenation of the root
directory **c:/** with a subdirectory **/windows/system** will yield
**c://windows/system** (two slashes together), which refers to the
mount point called **system** on the machine called **windows** (and
the **c:/** is ignored), and is not equivalent to
**c:/windows/system**, which describes a directory on the current
computer. The **file join** command should be used to concatenate
path components.

Note that there are two general types of Win32 console applications:

&gt; \[1\]
&gt;
&gt; :   CLI --- CommandLine Interface, simple stdio exchange.
&gt;     **netstat.exe** for example.
&gt;
&gt; \[2\]
&gt;
&gt; :   TUI --- Textmode User Interface, any application that accesses
&gt;     the console API for doing such things as cursor movement,
&gt;     setting text color, detecting key presses and mouse movement,
&gt;     etc. An example would be **telnet.exe** from Windows 2000.
&gt;     These types of applications are not common in a windows
&gt;     environment, but do exist.

**exec** will not work well with TUI applications when a console is
not present, as is done when launching applications under wish. It
is desirable to have console applications hidden and detached. This
is a designed-in limitation as **exec** wants to communicate over
pipes. The Expect extension addresses this issue when communicating
with a TUI application.

When attempting to execute an application, **exec** first searches
for the name as it was specified. Then, in order, **.com**,
**.exe**, **.bat** and **.cmd** are appended to the end of the
specified name and it searches for the longer name. If a directory
name was not specified as part of the application name, the
following directories are automatically searched in order when
attempting to locate the application:

-   The directory from which the Tcl executable was loaded.

-   The current directory.

-   The Windows 32-bit system directory.

-   The Windows home directory.

-   The directories listed in the path.

In order to execute shell built-in commands like **dir** and
**copy**, the caller must prepend the desired command with because
built-in commands are not implemented using executables.

<p><strong>Unix</strong> (including Mac OS X)</p>
<p>:   The <strong>exec</strong> command is fully functional and works as described.</p>
<h1 id="unix-examples">UNIX EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>Here are some examples of the use of the <strong>exec</strong> command on Unix. To
execute a simple program and get its result:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>exec uname -a
</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="working-with-non-zero-results">WORKING WITH NON-ZERO RESULTS</h2>
<p>To execute a program that can return a non-zero result, you should wrap
the call to <strong>exec</strong> in <strong>catch</strong> and check the contents of the
<strong>-errorcode</strong> return option if you have an error:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>set status 0
if {[catch {exec grep foo bar.txt} results options]} {
    set details [dict get $options -errorcode]
    if {[lindex $details 0] eq &quot;CHILDSTATUS&quot;} {
        set status [lindex $details 2]
    } else {
        # Some other error; regenerate it to let caller handle
        return -options $options -level 0 $results
    }
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>This is more easily written using the <strong>try</strong> command, as that makes it
simpler to trap specific types of errors. This is done using code like
this:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>try {
    set results [exec grep foo bar.txt]
    set status 0
} trap CHILDSTATUS {results options} {
    set status [lindex [dict get $options -errorcode] 2]
}
</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="working-with-quoted-arguments">WORKING WITH QUOTED ARGUMENTS</h2>
<p>When translating a command from a Unix shell invocation, care should be
taken over the fact that single quote characters have no special
significance to Tcl. Thus:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>awk &#39;{sum += $1} END {print sum}&#39; numbers.list
</code></pre></div>
<p>would be translated into something like:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>exec awk {{sum += $1} END {print sum}} numbers.list
</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="working-with-globbing">WORKING WITH GLOBBING</h2>
<p>If you are converting invocations involving shell globbing, you should
remember that Tcl does not handle globbing or expand things into
multiple arguments by default. Instead you should write things like
this:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>exec ls -l {*}[glob *.tcl]
</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="working-with-user-supplied-shell-script-fragments">WORKING WITH USER-SUPPLIED SHELL SCRIPT FRAGMENTS</h2>
<p>One useful technique can be to expose to users of a script the ability
to specify a fragment of shell script to execute that will have some
data passed in on standard input that was produced by the Tcl program.
This is a common technique for using the <em>lpr</em> program for printing. By
far the simplest way of doing this is to pass the user\'s script to the
user\'s shell for processing, as this avoids a lot of complexity with
parsing other languages.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>set lprScript [get from user...]
set postscriptData [generate somehow...]

exec $env(SHELL) -c $lprScript &lt;&lt; $postscriptData
</code></pre></div>
<h1 id="windows-examples">WINDOWS EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>Here are some examples of the use of the <strong>exec</strong> command on Windows. To
start an instance of <em>notepad</em> editing a file without waiting for the
user to finish editing the file:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>exec notepad myfile.txt &amp;
</code></pre></div>
<p>To print a text file using <em>notepad</em>:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>exec notepad /p myfile.txt
</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="working-with-console-programs">WORKING WITH CONSOLE PROGRAMS</h2>
<p>If a program calls other programs, such as is common with compilers,
then you may need to resort to batch files to hide the console windows
that sometimes pop up:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>exec cmp.bat somefile.c -o somefile
</code></pre></div>
<p>With the file <em>cmp.bat</em> looking something like:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>@gcc %*
</code></pre></div>
<p>or like another variant using single parameters:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>@gcc %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9
</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="working-with-command-built-ins">WORKING WITH COMMAND BUILT-INS</h2>
<p>Sometimes you need to be careful, as different programs may have the
same name and be in the path. It can then happen that typing a command
at the DOS prompt finds <em>a different program</em> than the same command run
via <strong>exec</strong>. This is because of the (documented) differences in
behaviour between <strong>exec</strong> and DOS batch files.</p>
<p>When in doubt, use the command <strong>auto_execok</strong>: it will return the
complete path to the program as seen by the <strong>exec</strong> command. This
applies especially when you want to run commands like <em>dir</em> from a Tcl
script (if you just want to list filenames, use the <strong>glob</strong> command.)
To do that, use this:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>exec {*}[auto_execok dir] *.tcl
</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="working-with-native-filenames">WORKING WITH NATIVE FILENAMES</h2>
<p>Many programs on Windows require filename arguments to be passed in with
backslashes as pathname separators. This is done with the help of the
<strong>file nativename</strong> command. For example, to make a directory (on NTFS)
encrypted so that only the current user can access it requires use of
the <em>CIPHER</em> command, like this:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>set secureDir &quot;~/Desktop/Secure Directory&quot;
file mkdir $secureDir
exec CIPHER /e /s:[file nativename $secureDir]
</code></pre></div>
