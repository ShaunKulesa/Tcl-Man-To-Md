<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This command keeps a simple database of the packages available for use
by the current interpreter and how to load them into the interpreter. It
supports multiple versions of each package and arranges for the correct
version of a package to be loaded based on what is needed by the
application. This command also detects and reports version clashes.
Typically, only the <strong>package require</strong> and <strong>package provide</strong> commands
are invoked in normal Tcl scripts; the other commands are used primarily
by system scripts that maintain the package database.</p>
<p>The behavior of the <strong>package</strong> command is determined by its first
argument. The following forms are permitted:</p>
<p><strong>package forget</strong> ?<em>package package ...</em>?</p>
<p>:   Removes all information about each specified package from this
    interpreter, including information provided by both <strong>package
    ifneeded</strong> and <strong>package provide</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>package ifneeded </strong><em>package version</em> ?<em>script</em>?</p>
<p>:   This command typically appears only in system configuration scripts
    to set up the package database. It indicates that a particular
    version of a particular package is available if needed, and that the
    package can be added to the interpreter by executing <em>script</em>. The
    script is saved in a database for use by subsequent <strong>package
    require</strong> commands; typically, <em>script</em> sets up auto-loading for the
    commands in the package (or calls <strong>load</strong> and/or <strong>source</strong>
    directly), then invokes <strong>package provide</strong> to indicate that the
    package is present. There may be information in the database for
    several different versions of a single package. If the database
    already contains information for <em>package</em> and <em>version</em>, the new
    <em>script</em> replaces the existing one. If the <em>script</em> argument is
    omitted, the current script for version <em>version</em> of package
    <em>package</em> is returned, or an empty string if no <strong>package ifneeded</strong>
    command has been invoked for this <em>package</em> and <em>version</em>.</p>
<p><strong>package names</strong></p>
<p>:   Returns a list of the names of all packages in the interpreter for
    which a version has been provided (via <strong>package provide</strong>) or for
    which a <strong>package ifneeded</strong> script is available. The order of
    elements in the list is arbitrary.</p>
<p><strong>package present</strong> ?<strong>-exact</strong>? <em>package</em> ?<em>requirement...</em>?</p>
<p>:   This command is equivalent to <strong>package require</strong> except that it
    does not try and load the package if it is not already loaded.</p>
<p><strong>package provide </strong><em>package </em>?<em>version</em>?</p>
<p>:   This command is invoked to indicate that version <em>version</em> of
    package <em>package</em> is now present in the interpreter. It is typically
    invoked once as part of an <strong>ifneeded</strong> script, and again by the
    package itself when it is finally loaded. An error occurs if a
    different version of <em>package</em> has been provided by a previous
    <strong>package provide</strong> command. If the <em>version</em> argument is omitted,
    then the command returns the version number that is currently
    provided, or an empty string if no <strong>package provide</strong> command has
    been invoked for <em>package</em> in this interpreter.</p>
<p><strong>package require </strong><em>package </em>?<em>requirement...</em>?</p>
<p>:   This command is typically invoked by Tcl code that wishes to use a
    particular version of a particular package. The arguments indicate
    which package is wanted, and the command ensures that a suitable
    version of the package is loaded into the interpreter. If the
    command succeeds, it returns the version number that is loaded;
    otherwise it generates an error.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>A suitable version of the package is any version which satisfies at
least one of the requirements, per the rules of **package**
vsatisfies. If multiple versions are suitable the implementation
with the highest version is chosen. This last part is additionally
influenced by the selection mode set with **package prefer**.

In the selection mode the command will select the highest stable
version satisfying the requirements, if any. If no stable version
satisfies the requirements, the highest unstable version satisfying
the requirements will be selected. In the selection mode the command
will accept the highest version satisfying all the requirements,
regardless of its stableness.

If a version of *package* has already been provided (by invoking the
**package provide** command), then its version number must satisfy
the *requirement*s and the command returns immediately. Otherwise,
the command searches the database of information provided by
previous **package ifneeded** commands to see if an acceptable
version of the package is available. If so, the script for the
highest acceptable version number is evaluated in the global
namespace; it must do whatever is necessary to load the package,
including calling **package provide** for the package. If the
**package ifneeded** database does not contain an acceptable version
of the package and a **package unknown** command has been specified
for the interpreter then that command is evaluated in the global
namespace; when it completes, Tcl checks again to see if the package
is now provided or if there is a **package ifneeded** script for it.
If all of these steps fail to provide an acceptable version of the
package, then the command returns an error.
</code></pre></div>
<p><strong>package require -exact </strong><em>package version</em></p>
<p>:   This form of the command is used when only the given <em>version</em> of
    <em>package</em> is acceptable to the caller. This command is equivalent to
    <strong>package require </strong><em>package version</em>-<em>version</em>.</p>
<p><strong>package unknown </strong>?<em>command</em>?</p>
<p>:   This command supplies a command to invoke during <strong>package require</strong>
    if no suitable version of a package can be found in the <strong>package
    ifneeded</strong> database. If the <em>command</em> argument is supplied, it
    contains the first part of a command; when the command is invoked
    during a <strong>package require</strong> command, Tcl appends one or more
    additional arguments giving the desired package name and
    requirements. For example, if <em>command</em> is <strong>foo bar</strong> and later the
    command <strong>package require test 2.4</strong> is invoked, then Tcl will
    execute the command <strong>foo bar test 2.4</strong> to load the package. If no
    requirements are supplied to the <strong>package require</strong> command, then
    only the name will be added to invoked command. If the <strong>package
    unknown</strong> command is invoked without a <em>command</em> argument, then the
    current <strong>package unknown</strong> script is returned, or an empty string
    if there is none. If <em>command</em> is specified as an empty string, then
    the current <strong>package unknown</strong> script is removed, if there is one.</p>
<p><strong>package vcompare </strong><em>version1 version2</em></p>
<p>:   Compares the two version numbers given by <em>version1</em> and <em>version2</em>.
    Returns -1 if <em>version1</em> is an earlier version than <em>version2</em>, 0 if
    they are equal, and 1 if <em>version1</em> is later than <em>version2</em>.</p>
<p><strong>package versions </strong><em>package</em></p>
<p>:   Returns a list of all the version numbers of <em>package</em> for which
    information has been provided by <strong>package ifneeded</strong> commands.</p>
<p><strong>package vsatisfies </strong><em>version requirement...</em></p>
<p>:   Returns 1 if the <em>version</em> satisfies at least one of the given
    requirements, and 0 otherwise. Each <em>requirement</em> is allowed to have
    any of the forms:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>min

case of the extended syntax, keeping backward compatibility.
Regarding satisfaction the rules are:

\[1\]

:   The *version* has to pass at least one of the listed
    *requirement*s to be satisfactory.

\[2\]

:   A version satisfies a requirement when

    \[a\]

    :   For *min* equal to the *max* if, and only if the *version*
        is equal to the *min*.

    \[b\]

    :   Otherwise if, and only if the *version* is greater than or
        equal to the *min*, and less than the *max*, where both
        *min* and *max* have been padded internally with Note that
        while the comparison to *min* is inclusive, the comparison
        to *max* is exclusive.

\[3\]

:   A requirement is a requirement in disguise, with the *max* part
    implicitly specified as the next higher major version number of
    the *min* part. A version satisfies it per the rules above.

\[4\]

:   A *version* satisfies a requirement if, and only if it is
    greater than or equal to the *min*, where the *min* has been
    padded internally with There is no constraint to a maximum.

<p><strong>package prefer </strong>?<strong>latest</strong>|<strong>stable</strong>?</p>
<p>:   With no arguments, the commands returns either or whichever
    describes the current mode of selection logic used by <strong>package
    require</strong>.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>When passed the argument it sets the selection logic mode to

When passed the argument if the mode is already that value is kept.
If the mode is already then the attempt to set it back to is
ineffective and the mode value remains

When passed any other value as an argument, raise an invalid
argument error.

When an interpreter is created, its initial selection mode value is
set to unless the environment variable **TCL_PKG_PREFER_LATEST** is
set. If that environment variable is defined (with any value) then
the initial (and permanent) selection mode value is set to
</code></pre></div>
<h1 id="version-numbers">VERSION NUMBERS</h1>
<p>Version numbers consist of one or more decimal numbers separated by
dots, such as 2 or 1.162 or 3.1.13.1. The first number is called the
major version number. Larger numbers correspond to later versions of a
package, with leftmost numbers having greater significance. For example,
version 2.1 is later than 1.3 and version 3.4.6 is later than 3.3.5.
Missing fields are equivalent to zeroes: version 1.3 is the same as
version 1.3.0 and 1.3.0.0, so it is earlier than 1.3.1 or 1.3.0.2. In
addition, the letters (alpha) and/or (beta) may appear exactly once to
replace a dot for separation. These letters semantically add a negative
specifier into the version, where is -2, and is -1. Each may be
specified only once, and or are mutually exclusive in a specifier. Thus
1.3a1 becomes (semantically) 1.3.-2.1, 1.3b1 is 1.3.-1.1. Negative
numbers are not directly allowed in version specifiers. A version number
not containing the letters or as specified above is called a <strong>stable</strong>
version, whereas presence of the letters causes the version to be called
is <strong>unstable</strong>. A later version number is assumed to be upwards
compatible with an earlier version number as long as both versions have
the same major version number. For example, Tcl scripts written for
version 2.3 of a package should work unchanged under versions 2.3.2,
2.4, and 2.5.1. Changes in the major version number signify incompatible
changes: if code is written to use version 2.1 of a package, it is not
guaranteed to work unmodified with either version 1.7.3 or version 3.1.</p>
<h1 id="package-indices">PACKAGE INDICES</h1>
<p>The recommended way to use packages in Tcl is to invoke <strong>package
require</strong> and <strong>package provide</strong> commands in scripts, and use the
procedure <strong>pkg_mkIndex</strong> to create package index files. Once you have
done this, packages will be loaded automatically in response to
<strong>package require</strong> commands. See the documentation for <strong>pkg_mkIndex</strong>
for details.</p>
<h1 id="examples">EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>To state that a Tcl script requires the Tk and http packages, put this
at the top of the script:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>package require Tk
package require http
</code></pre></div>
<p>To test to see if the Snack package is available and load if it is
(often useful for optional enhancements to programs where the loss of
the functionality is not critical) do this:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>if {[catch {package require Snack}]} {
    # Error thrown - package not found.
    # Set up a dummy interface to work around the absence
} else {
    # We have the package, configure the app to use it
}
