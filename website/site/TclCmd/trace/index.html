<p>trace - Monitor variable accesses, command usages and command executions</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>trace </strong><em>option</em> ?<em>arg arg ...</em>?</p>
<p>\</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This command causes Tcl commands to be executed whenever certain
operations are invoked. The legal <em>option</em>s (which may be abbreviated)
are:</p>
<p><strong>trace add </strong><em>type name ops ?args?</em></p>
<p>:   Where <em>type</em> is <strong>command</strong>, <strong>execution</strong>, or <strong>variable</strong>.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>**trace add command** *name ops commandPrefix*

:   Arrange for *commandPrefix* to be executed (with additional
    arguments) whenever command *name* is modified in one of the
    ways given by the list *ops*. *Name* will be resolved using the
    usual namespace resolution rules used by commands. If the
    command does not exist, an error will be thrown.

    *Ops* indicates which operations are of interest, and is a list
    of one or more of the following items:

    **rename**

    :   Invoke *commandPrefix* whenever the traced command is
        renamed. Note that renaming to the empty string is
        considered deletion, and will not be traced with

    **delete**

    :   Invoke *commandPrefix* when the traced command is deleted.
        Commands can be deleted explicitly by using the **rename**
        command to rename the command to an empty string. Commands
        are also deleted when the interpreter is deleted, but traces
        will not be invoked because there is no interpreter in which
        to execute them.

    When the trace triggers, depending on the operations being
    traced, a number of arguments are appended to *commandPrefix* so
    that the actual command is as follows:

        commandPrefix oldName newName op

    *OldName* and *newName* give the traced command\&#39;s current (old)
    name, and the name to which it is being renamed (the empty
    string if this is a operation). *Op* indicates what operation is
    being performed on the command, and is one of **rename** or
    **delete** as defined above. The trace operation cannot be used
    to stop a command from being deleted. Tcl will always remove the
    command once the trace is complete. Recursive renaming or
    deleting will not cause further traces of the same type to be
    evaluated, so a delete trace which itself deletes the command,
    or a rename trace which itself renames the command will not
    cause further trace evaluations to occur. Both *oldName* and
    *newName* are fully qualified with any namespace(s) in which
    they appear.

**trace add execution** *name ops commandPrefix*

:   Arrange for *commandPrefix* to be executed (with additional
    arguments) whenever command *name* is executed, with traces
    occurring at the points indicated by the list *ops*. *Name* will
    be resolved using the usual namespace resolution rules used by
    commands. If the command does not exist, an error will be
    thrown.

    *Ops* indicates which operations are of interest, and is a list
    of one or more of the following items:

    **enter**

    :   Invoke *commandPrefix* whenever the command *name* is
        executed, just before the actual execution takes place.

    **leave**

    :   Invoke *commandPrefix* whenever the command *name* is
        executed, just after the actual execution takes place.

    **enterstep**

    :   Invoke *commandPrefix* for every Tcl command which is
        executed from the start of the execution of the procedure
        *name* until that procedure finishes. *CommandPrefix* is
        invoked just before the actual execution of the Tcl command
        being reported takes place. For example if we have then an
        *enterstep* trace would be invoked just before is executed.
        Setting an *enterstep* trace on a command *name* that does
        not refer to a procedure will not result in an error and is
        simply ignored.

    **leavestep**

    :   Invoke *commandPrefix* for every Tcl command which is
        executed from the start of the execution of the procedure
        *name* until that procedure finishes. *CommandPrefix* is
        invoked just after the actual execution of the Tcl command
        being reported takes place. Setting a *leavestep* trace on a
        command *name* that does not refer to a procedure will not
        result in an error and is simply ignored.

    When the trace triggers, depending on the operations being
    traced, a number of arguments are appended to *commandPrefix* so
    that the actual command is as follows:

    For **enter** and **enterstep** operations:

        commandPrefix command-string op

    *Command-string* gives the complete current command being
    executed (the traced command for a **enter** operation, an
    arbitrary command for a **enterstep** operation), including all
    arguments in their fully expanded form. *Op* indicates what
    operation is being performed on the command execution, and is
    one of **enter** or **enterstep** as defined above. The trace
    operation can be used to stop the command from executing, by
    deleting the command in question. Of course when the command is
    subsequently executed, an error will occur.

    For **leave** and **leavestep** operations:

        commandPrefix command-string code result op

    *Command-string* gives the complete current command being
    executed (the traced command for a **enter** operation, an
    arbitrary command for a **enterstep** operation), including all
    arguments in their fully expanded form. *Code* gives the result
    code of that execution, and *result* the result string. *Op*
    indicates what operation is being performed on the command
    execution, and is one of **leave** or **leavestep** as defined
    above. Note that the creation of many **enterstep** or
    **leavestep** traces can lead to unintuitive results, since the
    invoked commands from one trace can themselves lead to further
    command invocations for other traces.

    *CommandPrefix* executes in the same context as the code that
    invoked the traced operation: thus the *commandPrefix*, if
    invoked from a procedure, will have access to the same local
    variables as code in the procedure. This context may be
    different than the context in which the trace was created. If
    *commandPrefix* invokes a procedure (which it normally does)
    then the procedure will have to use **upvar** or **uplevel**
    commands if it wishes to access the local variables of the code
    which invoked the trace operation.

    While *commandPrefix* is executing during an execution trace,
    traces on *name* are temporarily disabled. This allows the
    *commandPrefix* to execute *name* in its body without invoking
    any other traces again. If an error occurs while executing the
    *commandPrefix*, then the command *name* as a whole will return
    that same error.

    When multiple traces are set on *name*, then for *enter* and
    *enterstep* operations, the traced commands are invoked in the
    reverse order of how the traces were originally created; and for
    *leave* and *leavestep* operations, the traced commands are
    invoked in the original order of creation.

    The behavior of execution traces is currently undefined for a
    command *name* imported into another namespace.

**trace add variable*** name ops commandPrefix*

:   Arrange for *commandPrefix* to be executed whenever variable
    *name* is accessed in one of the ways given by the list *ops*.
    *Name* may refer to a normal variable, an element of an array,
    or to an array as a whole (i.e. *name* may be just the name of
    an array, with no parenthesized index). If *name* refers to a
    whole array, then *commandPrefix* is invoked whenever any
    element of the array is manipulated. If the variable does not
    exist, it will be created but will not be given a value, so it
    will be visible to **namespace which** queries, but not to
    **info exists** queries.

    *Ops* indicates which operations are of interest, and is a list
    of one or more of the following items:

    **array**

    :   Invoke *commandPrefix* whenever the variable is accessed or
        modified via the **array** command, provided that *name* is
        not a scalar variable at the time that the **array** command
        is invoked. If *name* is a scalar variable, the access via
        the **array** command will not trigger the trace.

    **read**

    :   Invoke *commandPrefix* whenever the variable is read.

    **write**

    :   Invoke *commandPrefix* whenever the variable is written.

    **unset**

    :   Invoke *commandPrefix* whenever the variable is unset.
        Variables can be unset explicitly with the **unset**
        command, or implicitly when procedures return (all of their
        local variables are unset). Variables are also unset when
        interpreters are deleted, but traces will not be invoked
        because there is no interpreter in which to execute them.

    When the trace triggers, three arguments are appended to
    *commandPrefix* so that the actual command is as follows:

        commandPrefix name1 name2 op

    *Name1* and *name2* give the name(s) for the variable being
    accessed: if the variable is a scalar then *name1* gives the
    variable\&#39;s name and *name2* is an empty string; if the variable
    is an array element then *name1* gives the name of the array and
    name2 gives the index into the array; if an entire array is
    being deleted and the trace was registered on the overall array,
    rather than a single element, then *name1* gives the array name
    and *name2* is an empty string. *Name1* and *name2* are not
    necessarily the same as the name used in the **trace variable**
    command: the **upvar** command allows a procedure to reference a
    variable under a different name. *Op* indicates what operation
    is being performed on the variable, and is one of **read**,
    **write**, or **unset** as defined above.

    *CommandPrefix* executes in the same context as the code that
    invoked the traced operation: if the variable was accessed as
    part of a Tcl procedure, then *commandPrefix* will have access
    to the same local variables as code in the procedure. This
    context may be different than the context in which the trace was
    created. If *commandPrefix* invokes a procedure (which it
    normally does) then the procedure will have to use **upvar** or
    **uplevel** if it wishes to access the traced variable. Note
    also that *name1* may not necessarily be the same as the name
    used to set the trace on the variable; differences can occur if
    the access is made through a variable defined with the **upvar**
    command.

    For read and write traces, *commandPrefix* can modify the
    variable to affect the result of the traced operation. If
    *commandPrefix* modifies the value of a variable during a read
    or write trace, then the new value will be returned as the
    result of the traced operation. The return value from
    *commandPrefix* is ignored except that if it returns an error of
    any sort then the traced operation also returns an error with
    the same error message returned by the trace command (this
    mechanism can be used to implement read-only variables, for
    example). For write traces, *commandPrefix* is invoked after the
    variable\&#39;s value has been changed; it can write a new value
    into the variable to override the original value specified in
    the write operation. To implement read-only variables,
    *commandPrefix* will have to restore the old value of the
    variable.

    While *commandPrefix* is executing during a read or write trace,
    traces on the variable are temporarily disabled. This means that
    reads and writes invoked by *commandPrefix* will occur directly,
    without invoking *commandPrefix* (or any other traces) again.
    However, if *commandPrefix* unsets the variable then unset
    traces will be invoked.

    When an unset trace is invoked, the variable has already been
    deleted: it will appear to be undefined with no traces. If an
    unset occurs because of a procedure return, then the trace will
    be invoked in the variable context of the procedure being
    returned to: the stack frame of the returning procedure will no
    longer exist. Traces are not disabled during unset traces, so if
    an unset trace command creates a new trace and accesses the
    variable, the trace will be invoked. Any errors in unset traces
    are ignored.

    If there are multiple traces on a variable they are invoked in
    order of creation, most-recent first. If one trace returns an
    error, then no further traces are invoked for the variable. If
    an array element has a trace set, and there is also a trace set
    on the array as a whole, the trace on the overall array is
    invoked before the one on the element.

    Once created, the trace remains in effect either until the trace
    is removed with the **trace remove variable** command described
    below, until the variable is unset, or until the interpreter is
    deleted. Unsetting an element of array will remove any traces on
    that element, but will not remove traces on the overall array.

    This command returns an empty string.

<p>For backwards compatibility, three other subcommands are available:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>trace variable </strong><em>name ops command</em></p>
<p>:   This is equivalent to <strong>trace add variable </strong><em>name ops command</em>.</p>
<p><strong>trace vdelete </strong><em>name ops command</em></p>

<p><strong>trace vinfo </strong><em>name</em></p>
<p>:   This is equivalent to <strong>trace info variable </strong><em>name</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These subcommands are deprecated and will likely be removed in a future
version of Tcl. They use an older syntax in which <strong>array</strong>, <strong>read</strong>,
<strong>write</strong>, <strong>unset</strong> are replaced by <strong>a</strong>, <strong>r</strong>, <strong>w</strong> and <strong>u</strong>
respectively, and the <em>ops</em> argument is not a list, but simply a string
concatenation of the operations, such as <strong>rwua</strong>.</p>
