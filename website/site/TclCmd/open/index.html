<h1 id="name">NAME</h1>
<p>open - Open a file-based or command pipeline channel</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>open </strong><em>fileName</em>\
<strong>open </strong><em>fileName access</em>\
<strong>open </strong><em>fileName access permissions</em></p>
<p>\</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This command opens a file, serial port, or command pipeline and returns
a channel identifier that may be used in future invocations of commands
like <strong>read</strong>, <strong>puts</strong>, and <strong>close</strong>. If the first character of
<em>fileName</em> is not <strong>|</strong> then the command opens a file: <em>fileName</em> gives
the name of the file to open, and it must conform to the conventions
described in the <strong>filename</strong> manual entry.</p>
<p>The <em>access</em> argument, if present, indicates the way in which the file
(or command pipeline) is to be accessed. In the first form <em>access</em> may
have any of the following values:</p>
<p><strong>r</strong></p>
<p>:   Open the file for reading only; the file must already exist. This is
    the default value if <em>access</em> is not specified.</p>
<p><strong>r+</strong></p>
<p>:   Open the file for both reading and writing; the file must already
    exist.</p>
<p><strong>w</strong></p>
<p>:   Open the file for writing only. Truncate it if it exists. If it does
    not exist, create a new file.</p>
<p><strong>w+</strong></p>
<p>:   Open the file for reading and writing. Truncate it if it exists. If
    it does not exist, create a new file.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong></p>
<p>:   Open the file for writing only. If the file does not exist, create a
    new empty file. Set the file pointer to the end of the file prior to
    each write.</p>
<p><strong>a+</strong></p>
<p>:   Open the file for reading and writing. If the file does not exist,
    create a new empty file. Set the initial access position to the end
    of the file.</p>
<p>All of the legal <em>access</em> values above may have the character <strong>b</strong>
added as the second or third character in the value to indicate that the
opened channel should be configured as if with the <strong>fconfigure</strong>
<strong>-translation binary</strong> option, making the channel suitable for reading
or writing of binary data.</p>
<p>In the second form, <em>access</em> consists of a list of any of the following
flags, most of which have the standard POSIX meanings. One of the flags
must be either <strong>RDONLY</strong>, <strong>WRONLY</strong> or <strong>RDWR</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>RDONLY</strong></p>
<p>:   Open the file for reading only.</p>
<p><strong>WRONLY</strong></p>
<p>:   Open the file for writing only.</p>
<p><strong>RDWR</strong></p>
<p>:   Open the file for both reading and writing.</p>
<p><strong>APPEND</strong></p>
<p>:   Set the file pointer to the end of the file prior to each write.</p>
<p><strong>BINARY</strong></p>
<p>:   Configure the opened channel with the <strong>-translation binary</strong>
    option.</p>
<p><strong>CREAT</strong></p>
<p>:   Create the file if it does not already exist (without this flag it
    is an error for the file not to exist).</p>
<p><strong>EXCL</strong></p>
<p>:   If <strong>CREAT</strong> is also specified, an error is returned if the file
    already exists.</p>
<p><strong>NOCTTY</strong></p>
<p>:   If the file is a terminal device, this flag prevents the file from
    becoming the controlling terminal of the process.</p>
<p><strong>NONBLOCK</strong></p>
<p>:   Prevents the process from blocking while opening the file, and
    possibly in subsequent I/O operations. The exact behavior of this
    flag is system- and device-dependent; its use is discouraged (it is
    better to use the <strong>fconfigure</strong> command to put a file in
    nonblocking mode). For details refer to your system documentation on
    the <strong>open</strong> system call\'s <strong>O_NONBLOCK</strong> flag.</p>
<p><strong>TRUNC</strong></p>
<p>:   If the file exists it is truncated to zero length.</p>
<p>If a new file is created as part of opening it, <em>permissions</em> (an
integer) is used to set the permissions for the new file in conjunction
with the process\'s file mode creation mask. <em>Permissions</em> defaults to
0666.</p>
<h1 id="command-pipelines">COMMAND PIPELINES</h1>
<p>If the first character of <em>fileName</em> is then the remaining characters of
<em>fileName</em> are treated as a list of arguments that describe a command
pipeline to invoke, in the same style as the arguments for <strong>exec</strong>. In
this case, the channel identifier returned by <strong>open</strong> may be used to
write to the command\'s input pipe or read from its output pipe,
depending on the value of <em>access</em>. If write-only access is used (e.g.
<em>access</em> is then standard output for the pipeline is directed to the
current standard output unless overridden by the command. If read-only
access is used (e.g. <em>access</em> is standard input for the pipeline is
taken from the current standard input unless overridden by the command.
The id of the spawned process is accessible through the <strong>pid</strong> command,
using the channel id returned by <strong>open</strong> as argument.</p>
<p>If the command (or one of the commands) executed in the command pipeline
returns an error (according to the definition in <strong>exec</strong>), a Tcl error
is generated when <strong>close</strong> is called on the channel unless the pipeline
is in non-blocking mode then no exit status is returned (a silent
<strong>close</strong> with -blocking 0).</p>
<p>It is often useful to use the <strong>fileevent</strong> command with pipelines so
other processing may happen at the same time as running the command in
the background.</p>
<h1 id="serial-communications">SERIAL COMMUNICATIONS</h1>
<p>If <em>fileName</em> refers to a serial port, then the specified serial port is
opened and initialized in a platform-dependent manner. Acceptable values
for the <em>fileName</em> to use to open a serial port are described in the
PORTABILITY ISSUES section.</p>
<p>The <strong>fconfigure</strong> command can be used to query and set additional
configuration options specific to serial ports (where supported):</p>
<p><strong>-mode</strong> <em>baud</em><strong>,</strong><em>parity</em><strong>,</strong><em>data</em><strong>,</strong><em>stop</em></p>
<p>:   This option is a set of 4 comma-separated values: the baud rate,
    parity, number of data bits, and number of stop bits for this serial
    port. The <em>baud</em> rate is a simple integer that specifies the
    connection speed. <em>Parity</em> is one of the following letters: <strong>n</strong>,
    <strong>o</strong>, <strong>e</strong>, <strong>m</strong>, <strong>s</strong>; respectively signifying the parity
    options of or <em>Data</em> is the number of data bits and should be an
    integer from 5 to 8, while <em>stop</em> is the number of stop bits and
    should be the integer 1 or 2.</p>
<p><strong>-handshake</strong> <em>type</em></p>
<p>:   (Windows and Unix). This option is used to setup automatic handshake
    control. Note that not all handshake types maybe supported by your
    operating system. The <em>type</em> parameter is case-independent.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>If *type* is **none** then any handshake is switched off. **rtscts**
activates hardware handshake. Hardware handshake signals are
described below. For software handshake **xonxoff** the handshake
characters can be redefined with **-xchar**. An additional hardware
handshake **dtrdsr** is available only under Windows. There is no
default handshake configuration, the initial value depends on your
operating system settings. The **-handshake** option cannot be
queried.
</code></pre></div>
<p><strong>-queue</strong></p>
<p>:   (Windows and Unix). The <strong>-queue</strong> option can only be queried. It
    returns a list of two integers representing the current number of
    bytes in the input and output queue respectively.</p>
<p><strong>-timeout</strong> <em>msec</em></p>
<p>:   (Windows and Unix). This option is used to set the timeout for
    blocking read operations. It specifies the maximum interval between
    the reception of two bytes in milliseconds. For Unix systems the
    granularity is 100 milliseconds. The <strong>-timeout</strong> option does not
    affect write operations or nonblocking reads. This option cannot be
    queried.</p>
<p><strong>-ttycontrol</strong> <em>{signal boolean signal boolean ...}</em></p>
<p>:   (Windows and Unix). This option is used to setup the handshake
    output lines (see below) permanently or to send a BREAK over the
    serial line. The <em>signal</em> names are case-independent. <strong>{RTS 1 DTR
    0}</strong> sets the RTS output to high and the DTR output to low. The
    BREAK condition (see below) is enabled and disabled with <strong>{BREAK
    1}</strong> and <strong>{BREAK 0}</strong> respectively. It is not a good idea to change
    the <strong>RTS</strong> (or <strong>DTR</strong>) signal with active hardware handshake
    <strong>rtscts</strong> (or <strong>dtrdsr</strong>). The result is unpredictable. The
    <strong>-ttycontrol</strong> option cannot be queried.</p>
<p><strong>-ttystatus</strong></p>
<p>:   (Windows and Unix). The <strong>-ttystatus</strong> option can only be queried.
    It returns the current modem status and handshake input signals (see
    below). The result is a list of signal,value pairs with a fixed
    order, e.g. <strong>{CTS 1 DSR 0 RING 1 DCD 0}</strong>. The <em>signal</em> names are
    returned upper case.</p>
<p><strong>-xchar</strong> <em>{xonChar xoffChar}</em></p>
<p>:   (Windows and Unix). This option is used to query or change the
    software handshake characters. Normally the operating system default
    should be DC1 (0x11) and DC3 (0x13) representing the ASCII standard
    XON and XOFF characters.</p>
<p><strong>-pollinterval</strong> <em>msec</em></p>
<p>:   (Windows only). This option is used to set the maximum time between
    polling for fileevents. This affects the time interval between
    checking for events throughout the Tcl interpreter (the smallest
    value always wins). Use this option only if you want to poll the
    serial port more or less often than 10 msec (the default).</p>
<p><strong>-sysbuffer</strong> <em>inSize</em></p>
<p>:   </p>
<p><strong>-sysbuffer</strong> <em>{inSize outSize}</em></p>
<p>:   (Windows only). This option is used to change the size of Windows
    system buffers for a serial channel. Especially at higher
    communication rates the default input buffer size of 4096 bytes can
    overrun for latent systems. The first form specifies the input
    buffer size, in the second form both input and output buffers are
    defined.</p>
<p><strong>-lasterror</strong></p>
<p>:   (Windows only). This option is query only. In case of a serial
    communication error, <strong>read</strong> or <strong>puts</strong> returns a general Tcl file
    I/O error. <strong>fconfigure</strong> <strong>-lasterror</strong> can be called to get a list
    of error details. See below for an explanation of the various error
    codes.</p>
<h1 id="serial-port-signals">SERIAL PORT SIGNALS</h1>
<p>RS-232 is the most commonly used standard electrical interface for
serial communications. A negative voltage (-3V..-12V) define a mark
(on=1) bit and a positive voltage (+3..+12V) define a space (off=0) bit
(RS-232C). The following signals are specified for incoming and outgoing
data, status lines and handshaking. Here we are using the terms
<em>workstation</em> for your computer and <em>modem</em> for the external device,
because some signal names (DCD, RI) come from modems. Of course your
external device may use these signal lines for other purposes.</p>
<p>TXD(output)</p>
<p>:   <strong>Transmitted Data:</strong> Outgoing serial data.</p>
<p>RXD(input)</p>
<p>:   <strong>Received Data:</strong>Incoming serial data.</p>
<p>RTS(output)</p>
<p>:   <strong>Request To Send:</strong> This hardware handshake line informs the modem
    that your workstation is ready to receive data. Your workstation may
    automatically reset this signal to indicate that the input buffer is
    full.</p>
<p>CTS(input)</p>
<p>:   <strong>Clear To Send:</strong> The complement to RTS. Indicates that the modem
    is ready to receive data.</p>
<p>DTR(output)</p>
<p>:   <strong>Data Terminal Ready:</strong> This signal tells the modem that the
    workstation is ready to establish a link. DTR is often enabled
    automatically whenever a serial port is opened.</p>
<p>DSR(input)</p>
<p>:   <strong>Data Set Ready:</strong> The complement to DTR. Tells the workstation
    that the modem is ready to establish a link.</p>
<p>DCD(input)</p>
<p>:   <strong>Data Carrier Detect:</strong> This line becomes active when a modem
    detects a signal.</p>
<p>RI(input)</p>
<p>:   <strong>Ring Indicator:</strong> Goes active when the modem detects an incoming
    call.</p>
<p>BREAK</p>
<p>:   A BREAK condition is not a hardware signal line, but a logical zero
    on the TXD or RXD lines for a long period of time, usually 250 to
    500 milliseconds. Normally a receive or transmit data signal stays
    at the mark (on=1) voltage until the next character is transferred.
    A BREAK is sometimes used to reset the communications line or change
    the operating mode of communications hardware.</p>
<h1 id="error-codes-windows-only">ERROR CODES (Windows only)</h1>
<p>A lot of different errors may occur during serial read operations or
during event polling in background. The external device may have been
switched off, the data lines may be noisy, system buffers may overrun or
your mode settings may be wrong. That is why a reliable software should
always <strong>catch</strong> serial read operations. In cases of an error Tcl
returns a general file I/O error. Then <strong>fconfigure</strong> <strong>-lasterror</strong> may
help to locate the problem. The following error codes may be returned.</p>
<p><strong>RXOVER</strong></p>
<p>:   Windows input buffer overrun. The data comes faster than your
    scripts reads it or your system is overloaded. Use <strong>fconfigure</strong>
    <strong>-sysbuffer</strong> to avoid a temporary bottleneck and/or make your
    script faster.</p>
<p><strong>TXFULL</strong></p>
<p>:   Windows output buffer overrun. Complement to RXOVER. This error
    should practically not happen, because Tcl cares about the output
    buffer status.</p>
<p><strong>OVERRUN</strong></p>
<p>:   UART buffer overrun (hardware) with data lost. The data comes faster
    than the system driver receives it. Check your advanced serial port
    settings to enable the FIFO (16550) buffer and/or setup a lower(1)
    interrupt threshold value.</p>
<p><strong>RXPARITY</strong></p>
<p>:   A parity error has been detected by your UART. Wrong parity settings
    with <strong>fconfigure</strong> <strong>-mode</strong> or a noisy data line (RXD) may cause
    this error.</p>
<p><strong>FRAME</strong></p>
<p>:   A stop-bit error has been detected by your UART. Wrong mode settings
    with <strong>fconfigure</strong> <strong>-mode</strong> or a noisy data line (RXD) may cause
    this error.</p>
<p><strong>BREAK</strong></p>
<p>:   A BREAK condition has been detected by your UART (see above).</p>
<h1 id="portability-issues">PORTABILITY ISSUES</h1>
<p><strong>Windows </strong></p>
<p>:   Valid values for <em>fileName</em> to open a serial port are of the form
    <strong>com</strong><em>X</em>, where <em>X</em> is a number, generally from 1 to 9. A legacy
    form accepted as well is <strong>com</strong><em>X</em><strong>:</strong>. This notation only works
    for serial ports from 1 to 9. An attempt to open a serial port that
    does not exist or has a number greater than 9 will fail. An
    alternate form of opening serial ports is to use the filename
    <strong>//./comX</strong>, where X is any number that corresponds to a serial
    port.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When running Tcl interactively, there may be some strange interactions
between the real console, if one is present, and a command pipeline
that uses standard input or output. If a command pipeline is opened
for reading, some of the lines entered at the console will be sent to
the command pipeline and some will be sent to the Tcl evaluator. If a
command pipeline is opened for writing, keystrokes entered into the
console are not visible until the pipe is closed. These problems only
occur because both Tcl and the child application are competing for the
console at the same time. If the command pipeline is started from a
script, so that Tcl is not accessing the console, or if the command
pipeline does not use standard input or output, but is redirected from
or to a file, then the above problems do not occur.</p>
<p>Files opened in the mode or with the <strong>APPEND</strong> flag set are
implemented by seeking immediately before each write, which is not an
atomic operation and does not carry the guarantee of strict appending
that is present on POSIX platforms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Unix</strong>       </p>
<p>:   Valid values for <em>fileName</em> to open a serial port are generally of
    the form <strong>/dev/tty</strong><em>X</em>, where <em>X</em> is <strong>a</strong> or <strong>b</strong>, but the name
    of any pseudo-file that maps to a serial port may be used. Advanced
    configuration options are only supported for serial ports when Tcl
    is built to use the POSIX serial interface.</p>
