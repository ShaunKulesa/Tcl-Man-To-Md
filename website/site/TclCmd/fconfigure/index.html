<p>fconfigure - Set and get options on a channel</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>fconfigure </strong><em>channelId</em> <strong>fconfigure </strong><em>channelId</em> <em>name</em>
<strong>fconfigure </strong><em>channelId</em> <em>name value </em>?<em>name value ...</em>?</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>fconfigure</strong> command sets and retrieves options for channels.</p>
<p><em>ChannelId</em> identifies the channel for which to set or query an option
and must refer to an open channel such as a Tcl standard channel
(<strong>stdin</strong>, <strong>stdout</strong>, or <strong>stderr</strong>), the return value from an
invocation of <strong>open</strong> or <strong>socket</strong>, or the result of a channel
creation command provided by a Tcl extension.</p>
<p>If no <em>name</em> or <em>value</em> arguments are supplied, the command returns a
list containing alternating option names and values for the channel. If
<em>name</em> is supplied but no <em>value</em> then the command returns the current
value of the given option. If one or more pairs of <em>name</em> and <em>value</em>
are supplied, the command sets each of the named options to the
corresponding <em>value</em>; in this case the return value is an empty string.</p>
<p>The options described below are supported for all channels. In addition,
each channel type may add options that only it supports. See the manual
entry for the command that creates each type of channels for the options
that that specific type of channel supports. For example, see the manual
entry for the <strong>socket</strong> command for additional options for sockets, and
the <strong>open</strong> command for additional options for serial devices.</p>
<p><strong>-blocking</strong> <em>boolean</em></p>
<p>:   The <strong>-blocking</strong> option determines whether I/O operations on the
    channel can cause the process to block indefinitely. The value of
    the option must be a proper boolean value. Channels are normally in
    blocking mode; if a channel is placed into nonblocking mode it will
    affect the operation of the <strong>gets</strong>, <strong>read</strong>, <strong>puts</strong>, <strong>flush</strong>,
    and <strong>close</strong> commands by allowing them to operate asynchronously;
    see the documentation for those commands for details. For
    nonblocking mode to work correctly, the application must be using
    the Tcl event loop (e.g. by calling <strong>Tcl_DoOneEvent</strong> or invoking
    the <strong>vwait</strong> command).</p>
<p><strong>-buffering</strong> <em>newValue</em></p>
<p>:   If <em>newValue</em> is <strong>full</strong> then the I/O system will buffer output
    until its internal buffer is full or until the <strong>flush</strong> command is
    invoked. If <em>newValue</em> is <strong>line</strong>, then the I/O system will
    automatically flush output for the channel whenever a newline
    character is output. If <em>newValue</em> is <strong>none</strong>, the I/O system will
    flush automatically after every output operation. The default is for
    <strong>-buffering</strong> to be set to <strong>full</strong> except for channels that
    connect to terminal-like devices; for these channels the initial
    setting is <strong>line</strong>. Additionally, <strong>stdin</strong> and <strong>stdout</strong> are
    initially set to <strong>line</strong>, and <strong>stderr</strong> is set to <strong>none</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>-buffersize</strong> <em>newSize</em></p>
<p>:   <em>Newvalue</em> must be an integer; its value is used to set the size of
    buffers, in bytes, subsequently allocated for this channel to store
    input or output. <em>Newvalue</em> must be between one and one million,
    allowing buffers of one to one million bytes in size.</p>
<p><strong>-encoding</strong> <em>name</em></p>
<p>:   This option is used to specify the encoding of the channel, so that
    the data can be converted to and from Unicode for use in Tcl. For
    instance, in order for Tcl to read characters from a Japanese file
    in <strong>shiftjis</strong> and properly process and display the contents, the
    encoding would be set to <strong>shiftjis</strong>. Thereafter, when reading from
    the channel, the bytes in the Japanese file would be converted to
    Unicode as they are read. Writing is also supported - as Tcl strings
    are written to the channel they will automatically be converted to
    the specified encoding on output.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>If a file contains pure binary data (for instance, a JPEG image),
the encoding for the channel should be configured to be **binary**.
Tcl will then assign no interpretation to the data in the file and
simply read or write raw bytes. The Tcl **binary** command can be
used to manipulate this byte-oriented data. It is usually better to
set the **-translation** option to **binary** when you want to
transfer binary data, as this turns off the other automatic
interpretations of the bytes in the stream as well.

The default encoding for newly opened channels is the same platform-
and locale-dependent system encoding used for interfacing with the
operating system, as returned by **encoding system**.
</code></pre></div>
<p><strong>-eofchar</strong> <em>char</em></p>
<p>:   </p>
<p><strong>-eofchar</strong> <strong>{</strong><em>inChar outChar</em><strong>}</strong></p>
<p>:   This option supports DOS file systems that use Control-z (\x1A) as
    an end of file marker. If <em>char</em> is not an empty string, then this
    character signals end-of-file when it is encountered during input.
    For output, the end-of-file character is output when the channel is
    closed. If <em>char</em> is the empty string, then there is no special end
    of file character marker. For read-write channels, a two-element
    list specifies the end of file marker for input and output,
    respectively. As a convenience, when setting the end-of-file
    character for a read-write channel you can specify a single value
    that will apply to both reading and writing. When querying the
    end-of-file character of a read-write channel, a two-element list
    will always be returned. The default value for <strong>-eofchar</strong> is the
    empty string in all cases except for files under Windows. In that
    case the <strong>-eofchar</strong> is Control-z (\x1A) for reading and the empty
    string for writing. The acceptable range for <strong>-eofchar</strong> values is
    \x01 - \x7F; attempting to set <strong>-eofchar</strong> to a value outside of
    this range will generate an error.</p>
<p><strong>-translation</strong> <em>mode</em></p>
<p>:   </p>
<p><strong>-translation</strong> <strong>{</strong><em>inMode outMode</em><strong>}</strong></p>
<p>:   In Tcl scripts the end of a line is always represented using a
    single newline character (\n). However, in actual files and devices
    the end of a line may be represented differently on different
    platforms, or even for different devices on the same platform. For
    example, under UNIX newlines are used in files, whereas
    carriage-return-linefeed sequences are normally used in network
    connections. On input (i.e., with <strong>gets</strong> and <strong>read</strong>) the Tcl I/O
    system automatically translates the external end-of-line
    representation into newline characters. Upon output (i.e., with
    <strong>puts</strong>), the I/O system translates newlines to the external
    end-of-line representation. The default translation mode, <strong>auto</strong>,
    handles all the common cases automatically, but the <strong>-translation</strong>
    option provides explicit control over the end of line translations.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>The value associated with **-translation** is a single item for
read-only and write-only channels. The value is a two-element list
for read-write channels; the read translation mode is the first
element of the list, and the write translation mode is the second
element. As a convenience, when setting the translation mode for a
read-write channel you can specify a single value that will apply to
both reading and writing. When querying the translation mode of a
read-write channel, a two-element list will always be returned. The
following values are currently supported:

**auto**

:   As the input translation mode, **auto** treats any of newline
    (**lf**), carriage return (**cr**), or carriage return followed
    by a newline (**crlf**) as the end of line representation. The
    end of line representation can even change from line-to-line,
    and all cases are translated to a newline. As the output
    translation mode, **auto** chooses a platform specific
    representation; for sockets on all platforms Tcl chooses
    **crlf**, for all Unix flavors, it chooses **lf**, and for the
    various flavors of Windows it chooses **crlf**. The default
    setting for **-translation** is **auto** for both input and
    output.

**binary**

:   No end-of-line translations are performed. This is nearly
    identical to **lf** mode, except that in addition **binary**
    mode also sets the end-of-file character to the empty string
    (which disables it) and sets the encoding to **binary** (which
    disables encoding filtering). See the description of
    **-eofchar** and **-encoding** for more information.

    Internally, i.e. when it comes to the actual behaviour of the
    translator this value **is** identical to **lf** and is
    therefore reported as such when queried. Even if **binary** was
    used to set the translation.

**cr**

:   The end of a line in the underlying file or device is
    represented by a single carriage return character. As the input
    translation mode, **cr** mode converts carriage returns to
    newline characters. As the output translation mode, **cr** mode
    translates newline characters to carriage returns.

**crlf**

:   The end of a line in the underlying file or device is
    represented by a carriage return character followed by a
    linefeed character. As the input translation mode, **crlf** mode
    converts carriage-return-linefeed sequences to newline
    characters. As the output translation mode, **crlf** mode
    translates newline characters to carriage-return-linefeed
    sequences. This mode is typically used on Windows platforms and
    for network connections.

**lf**

:   The end of a line in the underlying file or device is
    represented by a single newline (linefeed) character. In this
    mode no translations occur during either input or output. This
    mode is typically used on UNIX platforms.

<h1 id="standard-channels">STANDARD CHANNELS</h1>
<p>The Tcl standard channels (<strong>stdin</strong>, <strong>stdout</strong>, and <strong>stderr</strong>) can be
configured through this command like every other channel opened by the
Tcl library. Beyond the standard options described above they will also
support any special option according to their current type. If, for
example, a Tcl application is started by the <strong>inet</strong> super-server
common on Unix system its Tcl standard channels will be sockets and thus
support the socket options.</p>
<h1 id="examples">EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>Instruct Tcl to always send output to <strong>stdout</strong> immediately, whether or
not it is to a terminal:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>fconfigure stdout -buffering none
</code></pre></div>
<p>Open a socket and read lines from it without ever blocking the
processing of other events:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>set s [socket some.where.com 12345]
fconfigure $s -blocking 0
fileevent $s readable &quot;readMe $s&quot;
proc readMe chan {
    if {[gets $chan line] &lt; 0} {
        if {[eof $chan]} {
            close $chan
            return
        }
        # Could not read a complete line this time; Tcl&#39;s
        # internal buffering will hold the partial line for us
        # until some more data is available over the socket.
    } else {
        puts stdout $line
    }
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>Read a PPM-format image from a file:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code># Open the file and put it into Unix ASCII mode
set f [open teapot.ppm]
fconfigure $f -encoding ascii -translation lf

# Get the header
if {[gets $f] ne &quot;P6&quot;} {
    error &quot;not a raw-bits PPM&quot;
}

# Read lines until we have got non-comment lines
# that supply us with three decimal values.
set words {}
while {[llength $words] &lt; 3} {
    gets $f line
    if {[string match &quot;#*&quot; $line]} continue
    lappend words {*}[join [scan $line %d%d%d]]
}

# Those words supply the size of the image and its
# overall depth per channel. Assign to variables.
lassign $words xSize ySize depth

# Now switch to binary mode to pull in the data,
# one byte per channel (red,green,blue) per pixel.
fconfigure $f -translation binary
set numDataBytes [expr {3 * $xSize * $ySize}]
set data [read $f $numDataBytes]

close $f
