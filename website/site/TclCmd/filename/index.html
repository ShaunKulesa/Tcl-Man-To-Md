<p>filename - File name conventions supported by Tcl commands</p>
<h1 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>All Tcl commands and C procedures that take file names as arguments
expect the file names to be in one of three forms, depending on the
current platform. On each platform, Tcl supports file names in the
standard forms(s) for that platform. In addition, on all platforms, Tcl
supports a Unix-like syntax intended to provide a convenient way of
constructing simple file names. However, scripts that are intended to be
portable should not assume a particular form for file names. Instead,
portable scripts must use the <strong>file split</strong> and <strong>file</strong> join commands
to manipulate file names (see the <strong>file</strong> manual entry for more
details).</p>
<h1 id="path-types">PATH TYPES</h1>
<p>File names are grouped into three general types based on the starting
point for the path used to specify the file: absolute, relative, and
volume-relative. Absolute names are completely qualified, giving a path
to the file relative to a particular volume and the root directory on
that volume. Relative names are unqualified, giving a path to the file
relative to the current working directory. Volume-relative names are
partially qualified, either giving the path relative to the root
directory on the current volume, or relative to the current directory of
the specified volume. The <strong>file pathtype</strong> command can be used to
determine the type of a given path.</p>
<h1 id="path-syntax">PATH SYNTAX</h1>
<p>The rules for native names depend on the value reported in the Tcl
<strong>platform</strong> element of the <strong>tcl_platform</strong> array:</p>
<p><strong>Unix</strong></p>
<p>:   On Unix and Apple MacOS X platforms, Tcl uses path names where the
    components are separated by slashes. Path names may be relative or
    absolute, and file names may contain any character other than slash.
    The file names <strong>.</strong> and <strong>..</strong> are special and refer to the current
    directory and the parent of the current directory respectively.
    Multiple adjacent slash characters are interpreted as a single
    separator. Any number of trailing slash characters at the end of a
    path are simply ignored, so the paths <strong>foo</strong>, <strong>foo/</strong> and
    <strong>foo//</strong> are all identical, and in particular <strong>foo/</strong> does not
    necessarily mean a directory is being referred.</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>The following examples illustrate various forms of path names:

**/**

:   Absolute path to the root directory.

**/etc/passwd**

:   Absolute path to the file named **passwd** in the directory
    **etc** in the root directory.

**.**

:   Relative path to the current directory.

**foo**

:   Relative path to the file **foo** in the current directory.

**foo/bar**

:   Relative path to the file **bar** in the directory **foo** in
    the current directory.

**../foo**

:   Relative path to the file **foo** in the directory above the
    current directory.
</code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Windows</strong></p>
<p>:   On Microsoft Windows platforms, Tcl supports both drive-relative and
    UNC style names. Both <strong>/</strong> and <strong>\</strong> may be used as directory
    separators in either type of name. Drive-relative names consist of
    an optional drive specifier followed by an absolute or relative
    path. UNC paths follow the general form
    <strong>\\servername\sharename\path\file</strong>, but must at the very
    least contain the server and share components, i.e.
    <strong>\\servername\sharename</strong>. In both forms, the file names <strong>.</strong>
    and <strong>..</strong> are special and refer to the current directory and the
    parent of the current directory respectively. The following examples
    illustrate various forms of path names:</p>
<div class="language-text highlight"><pre><span></span><code>**\\\\Host\\share/file**

:   Absolute UNC path to a file called **file** in the root
    directory of the export point **share** on the host **Host**.
    Note that repeated use of **file dirname** on this path will
    give **//Host/share**, and will never give just **//Host**.

**c:foo**

:   Volume-relative path to a file **foo** in the current directory
    on drive **c**.

**c:/foo**

:   Absolute path to a file **foo** in the root directory of drive
    **c**.

**foo\\bar**

:   Relative path to a file **bar** in the **foo** directory in the
    current directory on the current volume.

**\\foo**

:   Volume-relative path to a file **foo** in the root directory of
    the current volume.

**\\\\foo**

:   Volume-relative path to a file **foo** in the root directory of
    the current volume. This is not a valid UNC path, so the
    assumption is that the extra backslashes are superfluous.
</code></pre></div>
<h1 id="tilde-substitution">TILDE SUBSTITUTION</h1>
<p>In addition to the file name rules described above, Tcl also supports
<em>csh</em>-style tilde substitution. If a file name starts with a tilde, then
the file name will be interpreted as if the first element is replaced
with the location of the home directory for the given user. If the tilde
is followed immediately by a separator, then the <strong>\$HOME</strong> environment
variable is substituted. Otherwise the characters between the tilde and
the next separator are taken as a user name, which is used to retrieve
the user\'s home directory for substitution. This works on Unix, MacOS X
and Windows (except very old releases).</p>
<p>Old Windows platforms do not support tilde substitution when a user name
follows the tilde. On these platforms, attempts to use a tilde followed
by a user name will generate an error that the user does not exist when
Tcl attempts to interpret that part of the path or otherwise access the
file. The behaviour of these paths when not trying to interpret them is
the same as on Unix. File names that have a tilde without a user name
will be correctly substituted using the <strong>\$HOME</strong> environment variable,
just like for Unix.</p>
<h1 id="portability-issues">PORTABILITY ISSUES</h1>
<p>Not all file systems are case sensitive, so scripts should avoid code
that depends on the case of characters in a file name. In addition, the
character sets allowed on different devices may differ, so scripts
should choose file names that do not contain special characters like:
<strong>\&lt;>:?\"/\|</strong>. The safest approach is to use names consisting of
alphanumeric characters only. Care should be taken with filenames which
contain spaces (common on Windows systems) and filenames where the
backslash is the directory separator (Windows native path names).</p>
<p>On Windows platforms there are file and path length restrictions.
Complete paths or filenames longer than about 260 characters will lead
to errors in most file operations.</p>
<p>Another Windows peculiarity is that any number of trailing dots in
filenames are totally ignored, so, for example, attempts to create a
file or directory with a name will result in the creation of a
file/directory with name This fact is reflected in the results of <strong>file
normalize</strong>. Furthermore, a file name consisting only of dots or dots
with trailing characters is illegal.</p>
