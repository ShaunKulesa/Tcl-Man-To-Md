# NAME

string - Manipulate strings

# SYNOPSIS

**string ***option arg *?*arg \...?*

\

# DESCRIPTION

Performs one of several string operations, depending on *option*. The
legal *option*s (which may be abbreviated) are:

**string cat** ?*string1*? ?*string2\...*?

:   

Concatenate the given *string*s just like placing them directly next to
each other and return the resulting compound string. If no *string*s are
present, the result is an empty string.

> This primitive is occasionally handier than juxtaposition of strings
> when mixed quoting is wanted, or when the aim is to return the result
> of a concatenation without resorting to **return** **-level 0**, and
> is more efficient than building a list of arguments and using **join**
> with an empty join string.

**string compare** ?**-nocase**? ?**-length*** length*? *string1 string2*

:   Perform a character-by-character comparison of strings *string1* and
    *string2*. Returns -1, 0, or 1, depending on whether *string1* is
    lexicographically less than, equal to, or greater than *string2*. If
    **-length** is specified, then only the first *length* characters
    are used in the comparison. If **-length** is negative, it is
    ignored. If **-nocase** is specified, then the strings are compared
    in a case-insensitive manner.

**string equal** ?**-nocase**? ?**-length*** length*? *string1 string2*

:   Perform a character-by-character comparison of strings *string1* and
    *string2*. Returns 1 if *string1* and *string2* are identical, or 0
    when not. If **-length** is specified, then only the first *length*
    characters are used in the comparison. If **-length** is negative,
    it is ignored. If **-nocase** is specified, then the strings are
    compared in a case-insensitive manner.

**string first ***needleString haystackString* ?*startIndex*?

:   Search *haystackString* for a sequence of characters that exactly
    match the characters in *needleString*. If found, return the index
    of the first character in the first such match within
    *haystackString*. If not found, return -1. If *startIndex* is
    specified (in any of the forms described in **STRING INDICES**),
    then the search is constrained to start with the character in
    *haystackString* specified by the index. For example,

        string first a 0a23456789abcdef 5

    will return **10**, but

        string first a 0123456789abcdef 11

    will return **-1**.

**string index ***string charIndex*

:   Returns the *charIndex*\'th character of the *string* argument. A
    *charIndex* of 0 corresponds to the first character of the string.
    *charIndex* may be specified as described in the **STRING INDICES**
    section.

    If *charIndex* is less than 0 or greater than or equal to the length
    of the string then this command returns an empty string.

**string is ***class* ?**-strict**? ?**-failindex ***varname*? *string*

:   Returns 1 if *string* is a valid member of the specified character
    class, otherwise returns 0. If **-strict** is specified, then an
    empty string returns 0, otherwise an empty string will return 1 on
    any class. If **-failindex** is specified, then if the function
    returns 0, the index in the string where the class was no longer
    valid will be stored in the variable named *varname*. The *varname*
    will not be set if **string is** returns 1. The following character
    classes are recognized (the class name can be abbreviated):

    alnum

    :   Any Unicode alphabet or digit character.

    alpha

    :   Any Unicode alphabet character.

    ascii

    :   Any character with a value less than \\u0080 (those that are in
        the 7-bit ascii range).

    boolean

    :   Any of the forms allowed to **Tcl_GetBoolean**.

    control

    :   Any Unicode control character.

    digit

    :   Any Unicode digit character. Note that this includes characters
        outside of the \[0-9\] range.

    double

    :   Any of the forms allowed to **Tcl_GetDoubleFromObj**.

    entier

    :   

    Any of the valid string formats for an integer value of arbitrary
    size in Tcl, with optional surrounding whitespace. The formats
    accepted are exactly those accepted by the C routine
    **Tcl_GetBignumFromObj**.

    false

    :   Any of the forms allowed to **Tcl_GetBoolean** where the value
        is false.

    graph

    :   Any Unicode printing character, except space.

    integer

    :   Any of the valid string formats for a 32-bit integer value in
        Tcl, with optional surrounding whitespace. In case of overflow
        in the value, 0 is returned and the *varname* will contain -1.

    list

    :   Any proper list structure, with optional surrounding whitespace.
        In case of improper list structure, 0 is returned and the
        *varname* will contain the index of the where the list parsing
        fails, or -1 if this cannot be determined.

    lower

    :   Any Unicode lower case alphabet character.

    print

    :   Any Unicode printing character, including space.

    punct

    :   Any Unicode punctuation character.

    space

    :   Any Unicode whitespace character, mongolian vowel separator
        (U+180e), zero width space (U+200b), word joiner (U+2060) or
        zero width no-break space (U+feff) (=BOM).

    true

    :   Any of the forms allowed to **Tcl_GetBoolean** where the value
        is true.

    upper

    :   Any upper case alphabet character in the Unicode character set.

    wideinteger

    :   Any of the valid forms for a wide integer in Tcl, with optional
        surrounding whitespace. In case of overflow in the value, 0 is
        returned and the *varname* will contain -1.

    wordchar

    :   Any Unicode word character. That is any alphanumeric character,
        and any Unicode connector punctuation characters (e.g.
        underscore).

    xdigit

    :   Any hexadecimal digit character (\[0-9A-Fa-f\]).

    In the case of **boolean**, **true** and **false**, if the function
    will return 0, then the *varname* will always be set to 0, due to
    the varied nature of a valid boolean value.

**string last ***needleString haystackString* ?*lastIndex*?

:   Search *haystackString* for a sequence of characters that exactly
    match the characters in *needleString*. If found, return the index
    of the first character in the last such match within
    *haystackString*. If there is no match, then return -1. If
    *lastIndex* is specified (in any of the forms described in **STRING
    INDICES**), then only the characters in *haystackString* at or
    before the specified *lastIndex* will be considered by the search.
    For example,

        string last a 0a23456789abcdef 15

    will return **10**, but

        string last a 0a23456789abcdef 9

    will return **1**.

**string length ***string*

:   Returns a decimal string giving the number of characters in
    *string*. Note that this is not necessarily the same as the number
    of bytes used to store the string. If the value is a byte array
    value (such as those returned from reading a binary encoded
    channel), then this will return the actual byte length of the value.

**string map** ?**-nocase**? *mapping string*

:   Replaces substrings in *string* based on the key-value pairs in
    *mapping*. *mapping* is a list of *key value key value \...* as in
    the form returned by **array get**. Each instance of a key in the
    string will be replaced with its corresponding value. If **-nocase**
    is specified, then matching is done without regard to case
    differences. Both *key* and *value* may be multiple characters.
    Replacement is done in an ordered manner, so the key appearing first
    in the list will be checked first, and so on. *string* is only
    iterated over once, so earlier key replacements will have no affect
    for later key matches. For example,

        string map {abc 1 ab 2 a 3 1 0} 1abcaababcabababc

    will return the string **01321221**.

    Note that if an earlier *key* is a prefix of a later one, it will
    completely mask the later one. So if the previous example is
    reordered like this,

        string map {1 0 ab 2 a 3 abc 1} 1abcaababcabababc

    it will return the string **02c322c222c**.

**string match** ?**-nocase**? *pattern* *string*

:   See if *pattern* matches *string*; return 1 if it does, 0 if it does
    not. If **-nocase** is specified, then the pattern attempts to match
    against the string in a case insensitive manner. For the two strings
    to match, their contents must be identical except that the following
    special sequences may appear in *pattern*:

    -   Matches any sequence of characters in *string*, including a null
        string.

    ?

    :   Matches any single character in *string*.

    \[chars\]

    :   Matches any character in the set given by *chars*. If a sequence
        of the form *x***-***y* appears in *chars*, then any character
        between *x* and *y*, inclusive, will match. When used with
        **-nocase**, the end points of the range are converted to lower
        case first. Whereas {\[A-z\]} matches when matching
        case-sensitively (since falls between the and with **-nocase**
        this is considered like {\[A-Za-z\]} (and probably what was
        meant in the first place).

    \\x

    :   Matches the single character *x*. This provides a way of
        avoiding the special interpretation of the characters
        **\*?\[\]\\** in *pattern*.

**string range ***string first last*

:   Returns a range of consecutive characters from *string*, starting
    with the character whose index is *first* and ending with the
    character whose index is *last*. An index of 0 refers to the first
    character of the string. *first* and *last* may be specified as for
    the **index** method. If *first* is less than zero then it is
    treated as if it were zero, and if *last* is greater than or equal
    to the length of the string then it is treated as if it were
    **end**. If *first* is greater than *last* then an empty string is
    returned.

**string repeat ***string count*

:   Returns *string* repeated *count* number of times.

**string replace ***string first last* ?*newstring*?

:   Removes a range of consecutive characters from *string*, starting
    with the character whose index is *first* and ending with the
    character whose index is *last*. An index of 0 refers to the first
    character of the string. *First* and *last* may be specified as for
    the **index** method. If *newstring* is specified, then it is placed
    in the removed character range. If *first* is less than zero then it
    is treated as if it were zero, and if *last* is greater than or
    equal to the length of the string then it is treated as if it were
    **end**. The initial string is returned untouched, if *first* is
    greater than *last*, or if *first* is equal to or greater than the
    length of the initial string, or *last* is less than 0.

**string reverse ***string*

:   Returns a string that is the same length as *string* but with its
    characters in the reverse order.

**string tolower ***string* ?*first*? ?*last*?

:   Returns a value equal to *string* except that all upper (or title)
    case letters have been converted to lower case. If *first* is
    specified, it refers to the first char index in the string to start
    modifying. If *last* is specified, it refers to the char index in
    the string to stop at (inclusive). *first* and *last* may be
    specified using the forms described in **STRING INDICES**.

**string totitle ***string* ?*first*? ?*last*?

:   Returns a value equal to *string* except that the first character in
    *string* is converted to its Unicode title case variant (or upper
    case if there is no title case variant) and the rest of the string
    is converted to lower case. If *first* is specified, it refers to
    the first char index in the string to start modifying. If *last* is
    specified, it refers to the char index in the string to stop at
    (inclusive). *first* and *last* may be specified using the forms
    described in **STRING INDICES**.

**string toupper ***string* ?*first*? ?*last*?

:   Returns a value equal to *string* except that all lower (or title)
    case letters have been converted to upper case. If *first* is
    specified, it refers to the first char index in the string to start
    modifying. If *last* is specified, it refers to the char index in
    the string to stop at (inclusive). *first* and *last* may be
    specified using the forms described in **STRING INDICES**.

**string trim ***string* ?*chars*?

:   Returns a value equal to *string* except that any leading or
    trailing characters present in the string given by *chars* are
    removed. If *chars* is not specified then white space is removed
    (any character for which **string is space** returns 1, and
    \"\\0\").

**string trimleft ***string* ?*chars*?

:   Returns a value equal to *string* except that any leading characters
    present in the string given by *chars* are removed. If *chars* is
    not specified then white space is removed (any character for which
    **string is space** returns 1, and \"\\0\").

**string trimright ***string* ?*chars*?

:   Returns a value equal to *string* except that any trailing
    characters present in the string given by *chars* are removed. If
    *chars* is not specified then white space is removed (any character
    for which **string is space** returns 1, and \"\\0\").

## OBSOLETE SUBCOMMANDS

These subcommands are currently supported, but are likely to go away in
a future release as their functionality is either virtually never used
or highly misleading.

**string bytelength ***string*

:   Returns a decimal string giving the number of bytes used to
    represent *string* in memory when encoded as Tcl\'s internal
    modified UTF-8; Tcl may use other encodings for *string* as well,
    and does not guarantee to only use a single encoding for a
    particular *string*. Because UTF-8 uses a variable number of bytes
    to represent Unicode characters, the byte length will not be the
    same as the character length in general. The cases where a script
    cares about the byte length are rare.

    In almost all cases, you should use the **string length** operation
    (including determining the length of a Tcl byte array value). Refer
    to the **Tcl_NumUtfChars** manual entry for more details on the
    UTF-8 representation.

    Formally, the **string bytelength** operation returns the content of
    the *length* field of the **Tcl_Obj** structure, after calling
    **Tcl_GetString** to ensure that the *bytes* field is populated.
    This is highly unlikely to be useful to Tcl scripts, as Tcl\'s
    internal encoding is not strict UTF-8, but rather a modified CESU-8
    with a denormalized NUL (identical to that used in a number of
    places by Java\'s serialization mechanism) to enable basic
    processing with non-Unicode-aware C functions. As this
    representation should only ever be used by Tcl\'s implementation,
    the number of bytes used to store the representation is of very low
    value (except to C extension code, which has direct access for the
    purpose of memory management, etc.)

    *Compatibility note:* it is likely that this subcommand will be
    withdrawn in a future version of Tcl. It is better to use the
    **encoding convertto** command to convert a string to a known
    encoding and then apply **string length** to that.

        string length [encoding convertto utf-8 $theString]

**string wordend ***string charIndex*

:   Returns the index of the character just after the last one in the
    word containing character *charIndex* of *string*. *charIndex* may
    be specified using the forms in **STRING INDICES**. A word is
    considered to be any contiguous range of alphanumeric (Unicode
    letters or decimal digits) or underscore (Unicode connector
    punctuation) characters, or any single character other than these.

**string wordstart ***string charIndex*

:   Returns the index of the first character in the word containing
    character *charIndex* of *string*. *charIndex* may be specified
    using the forms in **STRING INDICES**. A word is considered to be
    any contiguous range of alphanumeric (Unicode letters or decimal
    digits) or underscore (Unicode connector punctuation) characters, or
    any single character other than these.

# STRING INDICES

When referring to indices into a string (e.g., for **string index** or
**string range**) the following formats are supported:

integer

:   For any index value that passes **string is integer -strict**, the
    char specified at this integral index (e.g., **2** would refer to
    the in

end

:   The last char of the string (e.g., **end** would refer to the in

end-N

:   The last char of the string minus the specified integer offset *N*
    (e.g., would refer to the in

end+N

:   The last char of the string plus the specified integer offset *N*
    (e.g., would refer to the in

M+N

:   The char specified at the integral index that is the sum of integer
    values *M* and *N* (e.g., would refer to the in

M-N

:   The char specified at the integral index that is the difference of
    integer values *M* and *N* (e.g., would refer to the in

In the specifications above, the integer value *M* contains no trailing
whitespace and the integer value *N* contains no leading whitespace.

# EXAMPLE

Test if the string in the variable *string* is a proper non-empty prefix
of the string **foobar**.

    set length [string length $string]
    if {$length == 0} {
        set isPrefix 0
    } else {
        set isPrefix [string equal -length $length $string "foobar"]
    }
