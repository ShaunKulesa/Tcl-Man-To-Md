# NAME

platform - System identification support code and utilities

# SYNOPSIS

    package require platform ?1.0.10?

    platform::generic
    platform::identify
    platform::patterns identifier

\

# DESCRIPTION

The **platform** package provides several utility commands useful for
the identification of the architecture of a machine running Tcl.

Whilst Tcl provides the **tcl_platform** array for identifying the
current architecture (in particular, the platform and machine elements)
this is not always sufficient. This is because (on Unix machines)
**tcl_platform** reflects the values returned by the **uname** command
and these are not standardized across platforms and architectures. In
addition, on at least one platform (AIX) the **tcl_platform(machine)**
contains the CPU serial number.

Consequently, individual applications need to manipulate the values in
**tcl_platform** (along with the output of system specific utilities) -
which is both inconvenient for developers, and introduces the potential
for inconsistencies in identifying architectures and in naming
conventions.

The **platform** package prevents such fragmentation - i.e., it
establishes a standard naming convention for architectures running Tcl
and makes it more convenient for developers to identify the current
architecture a Tcl program is running on.

# COMMANDS

**platform::identify**

:   This command returns an identifier describing the platform the Tcl
    core is running on. The returned identifier has the general format
    *OS*-*CPU*. The *OS* part of the identifier may contain details like
    kernel version, libc version, etc., and this information may contain
    dashes as well. The *CPU* part will not contain dashes, making the
    preceding dash the last dash in the result.

**platform::generic**

:   This command returns a simplified identifier describing the platform
    the Tcl core is running on. In contrast to **platform::identify** it
    leaves out details like kernel version, libc version, etc. The
    returned identifier has the general format *OS*-*CPU*.

**platform::patterns ***identifier*

:   This command takes an identifier as returned by
    **platform::identify** and returns a list of identifiers describing
    compatible architectures.

# EXAMPLE

This can be used to allow an application to be shipped with multiple
builds of a shared library, so that the same package works on many
versions of an operating system. For example:

    package require platform
    # Assume that app script is .../theapp/bin/theapp.tcl
    set binDir [file dirname [file normalize [info script]]]
    set libDir [file join $binDir .. lib]
    set platLibDir [file join $libDir [platform::identify]]
    load [file join $platLibDir support[info sharedlibextension]]
