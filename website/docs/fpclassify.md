# NAME

fpclassify - Floating point number classification of Tcl values

# SYNOPSIS

package require **tcl 8.7**

**fpclassify ***value*

\

# DESCRIPTION

The **fpclassify** command takes a floating point number, *value*, and
returns one of the following strings that describe it:

**zero**

:   *value* is a floating point zero.

**subnormal**

:   *value* is the result of a gradual underflow.

**normal**

:   *value* is an ordinary floating-point number (not zero, subnormal,
    infinite, nor NaN).

**infinite**

:   *value* is a floating-point infinity.

**nan**

:   *value* is Not-a-Number.

The **fpclassify** command throws an error if value is not a
floating-point value and cannot be converted to one.

# EXAMPLE

This shows how to check whether the result of a computation is
numerically safe or not. (Note however that it does not guard against
numerical errors; just against representational problems.)

    set value [command-that-computes-a-value]
    switch [fpclassify $value] {
        normal - zero {
            puts "Result is $value"
        }
        infinite {
            puts "Result is infinite"
        }
        subnormal {
            puts "Result is $value - WARNING! precision lost"
        }
        nan {
            puts "Computation completely failed"
        }
    }
