# NAME

interp - Create and manipulate Tcl interpreters

# SYNOPSIS

**interp ***subcommand *?*arg arg \...*?

\

# DESCRIPTION

This command makes it possible to create one or more new Tcl
interpreters that co-exist with the creating interpreter in the same
application. The creating interpreter is called the *parent* and the new
interpreter is called a *child*. A parent can create any number of
children, and each child can itself create additional children for which
it is parent, resulting in a hierarchy of interpreters.

Each interpreter is independent from the others: it has its own name
space for commands, procedures, and global variables. A parent
interpreter may create connections between its children and itself using
a mechanism called an *alias*. An *alias* is a command in a child
interpreter which, when invoked, causes a command to be invoked in its
parent interpreter or in another child interpreter. The only other
connections between interpreters are through environment variables (the
**env** variable), which are normally shared among all interpreters in
the application, and by resource limit exceeded callbacks. Note that the
name space for files (such as the names returned by the **open**
command) is no longer shared between interpreters. Explicit commands are
provided to share files and to transfer references to open files from
one interpreter to another.

The **interp** command also provides support for *safe* interpreters. A
safe interpreter is a child whose functions have been greatly
restricted, so that it is safe to execute untrusted scripts without fear
of them damaging other interpreters or the application\'s environment.
For example, all IO channel creation commands and subprocess creation
commands are made inaccessible to safe interpreters. See **SAFE
INTERPRETERS** below for more information on what features are present
in a safe interpreter. The dangerous functionality is not removed from
the safe interpreter; instead, it is *hidden*, so that only trusted
interpreters can obtain access to it. For a detailed explanation of
hidden commands, see **HIDDEN COMMANDS**, below. The alias mechanism can
be used for protected communication (analogous to a kernel call) between
a child interpreter and its parent. See **ALIAS INVOCATION**, below, for
more details on how the alias mechanism works.

A qualified interpreter name is a proper Tcl list containing a subset of
its ancestors in the interpreter hierarchy, terminated by the string
naming the interpreter in its immediate parent. Interpreter names are
relative to the interpreter in which they are used. For example, if is a
child of the current interpreter and it has a child which in turn has a
child the qualified name of in is the list

The **interp** command, described below, accepts qualified interpreter
names as arguments; the interpreter in which the command is being
evaluated can always be referred to as **{}** (the empty list or
string). Note that it is impossible to refer to a parent (ancestor)
interpreter by name in a child interpreter except through aliases. Also,
there is no global name by which one can refer to the first interpreter
created in an application. Both restrictions are motivated by safety
concerns.

# THE INTERP COMMAND

The **interp** command is used to create, delete, and manipulate child
interpreters, and to share or transfer channels between interpreters. It
can have any of several forms, depending on the *subcommand* argument:

**interp** **alias** *srcPath* *srcToken*

:   Returns a Tcl list whose elements are the *targetCmd* and *arg*s
    associated with the alias represented by *srcToken* (this is the
    value returned when the alias was created; it is possible that the
    name of the source command in the child is different from
    *srcToken*).

**interp** **alias** *srcPath* *srcToken* **{}**

:   Deletes the alias for *srcToken* in the child interpreter identified
    by *srcPath*. *srcToken* refers to the value returned when the alias
    was created; if the source command has been renamed, the renamed
    command will be deleted.

**interp** **alias** *srcPath* *srcCmd* *targetPath* *targetCmd *?*arg arg \...*?

:   This command creates an alias between one child and another (see the
    **alias** child command below for creating aliases between a child
    and its parent). In this command, either of the child interpreters
    may be anywhere in the hierarchy of interpreters under the
    interpreter invoking the command. *SrcPath* and *srcCmd* identify
    the source of the alias. *SrcPath* is a Tcl list whose elements
    select a particular interpreter. For example, identifies an
    interpreter which is a child of interpreter which is a child of the
    invoking interpreter. An empty list specifies the interpreter
    invoking the command. *srcCmd* gives the name of a new command,
    which will be created in the source interpreter. *TargetPath* and
    *targetCmd* specify a target interpreter and command, and the *arg*
    arguments, if any, specify additional arguments to *targetCmd* which
    are prepended to any arguments specified in the invocation of
    *srcCmd*. *TargetCmd* may be undefined at the time of this call, or
    it may already exist; it is not created by this command. The alias
    arranges for the given target command to be invoked in the target
    interpreter whenever the given source command is invoked in the
    source interpreter. See **ALIAS INVOCATION** below for more details.
    The command returns a token that uniquely identifies the command
    created *srcCmd*, even if the command is renamed afterwards. The
    token may but does not have to be equal to *srcCmd*.

**interp** **aliases **?*path*?

:   This command returns a Tcl list of the tokens of all the source
    commands for aliases defined in the interpreter identified by
    *path*. The tokens correspond to the values returned when the
    aliases were created (which may not be the same as the current names
    of the commands).

**interp bgerror ***path* ?*cmdPrefix*?

:   This command either gets or sets the current background exception
    handler for the interpreter identified by *path*. If *cmdPrefix* is
    absent, the current background exception handler is returned, and if
    it is present, it is a list of words (of minimum length one) that
    describes what to set the interpreter\'s background exception
    handler to. See the **BACKGROUND EXCEPTION HANDLING** section for
    more details.

**interp** **cancel **?**-unwind**? ?**- -**? ?*path*? ?*result*?

:   

Cancels the script being evaluated in the interpreter identified by
*path*. Without the **-unwind** switch the evaluation stack for the
interpreter is unwound until an enclosing catch command is found or
there are no further invocations of the interpreter left on the call
stack. With the **-unwind** switch the evaluation stack for the
interpreter is unwound without regard to any intervening catch command
until there are no further invocations of the interpreter left on the
call stack. The **- -** switch can be used to mark the end of switches;
it may be needed if *path* is an unusual value such as **-safe**. If
*result* is present, it will be used as the error message string;
otherwise, a default error message string will be used.

**interp** **create **?**-safe**? ?**- -**? ?*path*?

:   Creates a child interpreter identified by *path* and a new command,
    called a *child command*. The name of the child command is the last
    component of *path*. The new child interpreter and the child command
    are created in the interpreter identified by the path obtained by
    removing the last component from *path*. For example, if *path* is
    **a b** c then a new child interpreter and child command named **c**
    are created in the interpreter identified by the path **a b**. The
    child command may be used to manipulate the new interpreter as
    described below. If *path* is omitted, Tcl creates a unique name of
    the form **interp***x*, where *x* is an integer, and uses it for the
    interpreter and the child command. If the **-safe** switch is
    specified (or if the parent interpreter is a safe interpreter), the
    new child interpreter will be created as a safe interpreter with
    limited functionality; otherwise the child will include the full set
    of Tcl built-in commands and variables. The **- -** switch can be
    used to mark the end of switches; it may be needed if *path* is an
    unusual value such as **-safe**. The result of the command is the
    name of the new interpreter. The name of a child interpreter must be
    unique among all the children for its parent; an error occurs if a
    child interpreter by the given name already exists in this parent.
    The initial recursion limit of the child interpreter is set to the
    current recursion limit of its parent interpreter.

**interp** **debug ***path* ?**-frame** ?*bool*??

:   Controls whether frame-level stack information is captured in the
    child interpreter identified by *path*. If no arguments are given,
    option and current setting are returned. If **-frame** is given, the
    debug setting is set to the given boolean if provided and the
    current setting is returned. This only affects the output of **info
    frame**, in that exact frame-level information for command
    invocation at the bytecode level is only captured with this setting
    on.

    For example, with code like

        proc mycontrol {... script} {
          ...
          uplevel 1 $script
          ...
        }

        proc dosomething {...} {
          ...
          mycontrol {
            somecode
          }
        }

    the standard setting will provide a relative line number for the
    command **somecode** and the relevant frame will be of type
    **eval**. With frame-debug active on the other hand the tracking
    extends so far that the system will be able to determine the file
    and absolute line number of this command, and return a frame of type
    **source**. This more exact information is paid for with slower
    execution of all commands.

    Note that once it is on, this flag cannot be switched back off: such
    attempts are silently ignored. This is needed to maintain the
    consistency of the underlying interpreter\'s state.

**interp** **delete **?*path \...?*

:   Deletes zero or more interpreters given by the optional *path*
    arguments, and for each interpreter, it also deletes its children.
    The command also deletes the child command for each interpreter
    deleted. For each *path* argument, if no interpreter by that name
    exists, the command raises an error.

**interp** **eval** *path arg *?*arg \...*?

:   This command concatenates all of the *arg* arguments in the same
    fashion as the **concat** command, then evaluates the resulting
    string as a Tcl script in the child interpreter identified by
    *path*. The result of this evaluation (including all **return**
    options, such as **-errorinfo** and **-errorcode** information, if
    an error occurs) is returned to the invoking interpreter. Note that
    the script will be executed in the current context stack frame of
    the *path* interpreter; this is so that the implementations (in a
    parent interpreter) of aliases in a child interpreter can execute
    scripts in the child that find out information about the child\'s
    current state and stack frame.

**interp exists ***path*

:   Returns **1** if a child interpreter by the specified *path* exists
    in this parent, **0** otherwise. If *path* is omitted, the invoking
    interpreter is used.

**interp expose ***path* *hiddenName* ?*exposedCmdName*?

:   Makes the hidden command *hiddenName* exposed, eventually bringing
    it back under a new *exposedCmdName* name (this name is currently
    accepted only if it is a valid global name space name without any
    ::), in the interpreter denoted by *path*. If an exposed command
    with the targeted name already exists, this command fails. Hidden
    commands are explained in more detail in **HIDDEN COMMANDS**, below.

**interp** **hide** *path* *exposedCmdName* ?*hiddenCmdName*?

:   Makes the exposed command *exposedCmdName* hidden, renaming it to
    the hidden command *hiddenCmdName*, or keeping the same name if
    *hiddenCmdName* is not given, in the interpreter denoted by *path*.
    If a hidden command with the targeted name already exists, this
    command fails. Currently both *exposedCmdName* and *hiddenCmdName*
    can not contain namespace qualifiers, or an error is raised.
    Commands to be hidden by **interp hide** are looked up in the global
    namespace even if the current namespace is not the global one. This
    prevents children from fooling a parent interpreter into hiding the
    wrong command, by making the current namespace be different from the
    global one. Hidden commands are explained in more detail in **HIDDEN
    COMMANDS**, below.

**interp** **hidden** *path*

:   Returns a list of the names of all hidden commands in the
    interpreter identified by *path*.

**interp** **invokehidden** *path* ?*-option \...*? *hiddenCmdName* ?*arg \...*?

:   Invokes the hidden command *hiddenCmdName* with the arguments
    supplied in the interpreter denoted by *path*. No substitutions or
    evaluation are applied to the arguments. Three *-option*s are
    supported, all of which start with **-**: **-namespace** (which
    takes a single argument afterwards, *nsName*), **-global**, and
    **- -**. If the **-namespace** flag is present, the hidden command
    is invoked in the namespace called *nsName* in the target
    interpreter. If the **-global** flag is present, the hidden command
    is invoked at the global level in the target interpreter; otherwise
    it is invoked at the current call frame and can access local
    variables in that and outer call frames. The **- -** flag allows the
    *hiddenCmdName* argument to start with a character, and is otherwise
    unnecessary. If both the **-namespace** and **-global** flags are
    present, the **-namespace** flag is ignored. Note that the hidden
    command will be executed (by default) in the current context stack
    frame of the *path* interpreter. Hidden commands are explained in
    more detail in **HIDDEN COMMANDS**, below.

**interp issafe** ?*path*?

:   Returns **1** if the interpreter identified by the specified *path*
    is safe, **0** otherwise.

**interp** **limit** *path* *limitType* ?*-option*? ?*value* *\...*?

:   Sets up, manipulates and queries the configuration of the resource
    limit *limitType* for the interpreter denoted by *path*. If no
    *-option* is specified, return the current configuration of the
    limit. If *-option* is the sole argument, return the value of that
    option. Otherwise, a list of *-option*/*value* argument pairs must
    supplied. See **RESOURCE LIMITS** below for a more detailed
    explanation of what limits and options are supported.

**interp marktrusted** *path*

:   Marks the interpreter identified by *path* as trusted. Does not
    expose the hidden commands. This command can only be invoked from a
    trusted interpreter. The command has no effect if the interpreter
    identified by *path* is already trusted.

**interp** **recursionlimit** *path* ?*newlimit*?

:   Returns the maximum allowable nesting depth for the interpreter
    specified by *path*. If *newlimit* is specified, the interpreter
    recursion limit will be set so that nesting of more than *newlimit*
    calls to **Tcl_Eval** and related procedures in that interpreter
    will return an error. The *newlimit* value is also returned. The
    *newlimit* value must be a positive integer between 1 and the
    maximum value of a non-long integer on the platform.

    The command sets the maximum size of the Tcl call stack only. It
    cannot by itself prevent stack overflows on the C stack being used
    by the application. If your machine has a limit on the size of the C
    stack, you may get stack overflows before reaching the limit set by
    the command. If this happens, see if there is a mechanism in your
    system for increasing the maximum size of the C stack.

**interp** **share** *srcPath channelId destPath*

:   Causes the IO channel identified by *channelId* to become shared
    between the interpreter identified by *srcPath* and the interpreter
    identified by *destPath*. Both interpreters have the same
    permissions on the IO channel. Both interpreters must close it to
    close the underlying IO channel; IO channels accessible in an
    interpreter are automatically closed when an interpreter is
    destroyed.

**interp** **slaves** ?*path*?

:   Returns a Tcl list of the names of all the child interpreters
    associated with the interpreter identified by *path*. If *path* is
    omitted, the invoking interpreter is used.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

**interp** **children** ?*path*?

:   Synonym for . **interp** **slaves** ?*path*?

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

**interp** **target** *path alias*

:   Returns a Tcl list describing the target interpreter for an alias.
    The alias is specified with an interpreter path and source command
    name, just as in **interp alias** above. The name of the target
    interpreter is returned as an interpreter path, relative to the
    invoking interpreter. If the target interpreter for the alias is the
    invoking interpreter then an empty list is returned. If the target
    interpreter for the alias is not the invoking interpreter or one of
    its descendants then an error is generated. The target command does
    not have to be defined at the time of this invocation.

**interp** **transfer** *srcPath channelId destPath*

:   Causes the IO channel identified by *channelId* to become available
    in the interpreter identified by *destPath* and unavailable in the
    interpreter identified by *srcPath*.

# child COMMAND

For each child interpreter created with the **interp** command, a new
Tcl command is created in the parent interpreter with the same name as
the new interpreter. This command may be used to invoke various
operations on the interpreter. It has the following general form:

    child command ?arg arg ...?

*child* is the name of the interpreter, and *command* and the *arg*s
determine the exact behavior of the command. The valid forms of this
command are:

*child ***aliases**

:   Returns a Tcl list whose elements are the tokens of all the aliases
    in *child*. The tokens correspond to the values returned when the
    aliases were created (which may not be the same as the current names
    of the commands).

*child ***alias ***srcToken*

:   Returns a Tcl list whose elements are the *targetCmd* and *arg*s
    associated with the alias represented by *srcToken* (this is the
    value returned when the alias was created; it is possible that the
    actual source command in the child is different from *srcToken*).

*child ***alias ***srcToken ***{}**

:   Deletes the alias for *srcToken* in the child interpreter.
    *srcToken* refers to the value returned when the alias was created;
    if the source command has been renamed, the renamed command will be
    deleted.

*child ***alias ***srcCmd targetCmd *?*arg ..*?

:   Creates an alias such that whenever *srcCmd* is invoked in *child*,
    *targetCmd* is invoked in the parent. The *arg* arguments will be
    passed to *targetCmd* as additional arguments, prepended before any
    arguments passed in the invocation of *srcCmd*. See **ALIAS
    INVOCATION** below for details. The command returns a token that
    uniquely identifies the command created *srcCmd*, even if the
    command is renamed afterwards. The token may but does not have to be
    equal to *srcCmd*.

*child ***bgerror** ?*cmdPrefix*?

:   This command either gets or sets the current background exception
    handler for the *child* interpreter. If *cmdPrefix* is absent, the
    current background exception handler is returned, and if it is
    present, it is a list of words (of minimum length one) that
    describes what to set the interpreter\'s background exception
    handler to. See the **BACKGROUND EXCEPTION HANDLING** section for
    more details.

*child ***eval ***arg *?*arg ..*?

:   This command concatenates all of the *arg* arguments in the same
    fashion as the **concat** command, then evaluates the resulting
    string as a Tcl script in *child*. The result of this evaluation
    (including all **return** options, such as **-errorinfo** and
    **-errorcode** information, if an error occurs) is returned to the
    invoking interpreter. Note that the script will be executed in the
    current context stack frame of *child*; this is so that the
    implementations (in a parent interpreter) of aliases in a child
    interpreter can execute scripts in the child that find out
    information about the child\'s current state and stack frame.

*child ***expose ***hiddenName *?*exposedCmdName*?

:   This command exposes the hidden command *hiddenName*, eventually
    bringing it back under a new *exposedCmdName* name (this name is
    currently accepted only if it is a valid global name space name
    without any ::), in *child*. If an exposed command with the targeted
    name already exists, this command fails. For more details on hidden
    commands, see **HIDDEN COMMANDS**, below.

*child ***hide ***exposedCmdName* ?*hiddenCmdName*?

:   This command hides the exposed command *exposedCmdName*, renaming it
    to the hidden command *hiddenCmdName*, or keeping the same name if
    the argument is not given, in the *child* interpreter. If a hidden
    command with the targeted name already exists, this command fails.
    Currently both *exposedCmdName* and *hiddenCmdName* can not contain
    namespace qualifiers, or an error is raised. Commands to be hidden
    are looked up in the global namespace even if the current namespace
    is not the global one. This prevents children from fooling a parent
    interpreter into hiding the wrong command, by making the current
    namespace be different from the global one. For more details on
    hidden commands, see **HIDDEN COMMANDS**, below.

*child ***hidden**

:   Returns a list of the names of all hidden commands in *child*.

*child ***invokehidden** ?*-option \...*? *hiddenName *?*arg ..*?

:   This command invokes the hidden command *hiddenName* with the
    supplied arguments, in *child*. No substitutions or evaluations are
    applied to the arguments. Three *-option*s are supported, all of
    which start with **-**: **-namespace** (which takes a single
    argument afterwards, *nsName*), **-global**, and **- -**. If the
    **-namespace** flag is given, the hidden command is invoked in the
    specified namespace in the child. If the **-global** flag is given,
    the command is invoked at the global level in the child; otherwise
    it is invoked at the current call frame and can access local
    variables in that or outer call frames. The **- -** flag allows the
    *hiddenCmdName* argument to start with a character, and is otherwise
    unnecessary. If both the **-namespace** and **-global** flags are
    given, the **-namespace** flag is ignored. Note that the hidden
    command will be executed (by default) in the current context stack
    frame of *child*. For more details on hidden commands, see **HIDDEN
    COMMANDS**, below.

*child ***issafe**

:   Returns **1** if the child interpreter is safe, **0** otherwise.

*child ***limit** *limitType* ?*-option*? ?*value* *\...*?

:   Sets up, manipulates and queries the configuration of the resource
    limit *limitType* for the child interpreter. If no *-option* is
    specified, return the current configuration of the limit. If
    *-option* is the sole argument, return the value of that option.
    Otherwise, a list of *-option*/*value* argument pairs must supplied.
    See **RESOURCE LIMITS** below for a more detailed explanation of
    what limits and options are supported.

*child ***marktrusted**

:   Marks the child interpreter as trusted. Can only be invoked by a
    trusted interpreter. This command does not expose any hidden
    commands in the child interpreter. The command has no effect if the
    child is already trusted.

*child* **recursionlimit** ?*newlimit*?

:   Returns the maximum allowable nesting depth for the *child*
    interpreter. If *newlimit* is specified, the recursion limit in
    *child* will be set so that nesting of more than *newlimit* calls to
    **Tcl_Eval()** and related procedures in *child* will return an
    error. The *newlimit* value is also returned. The *newlimit* value
    must be a positive integer between 1 and the maximum value of a
    non-long integer on the platform.

    The command sets the maximum size of the Tcl call stack only. It
    cannot by itself prevent stack overflows on the C stack being used
    by the application. If your machine has a limit on the size of the C
    stack, you may get stack overflows before reaching the limit set by
    the command. If this happens, see if there is a mechanism in your
    system for increasing the maximum size of the C stack.

# SAFE INTERPRETERS

A safe interpreter is one with restricted functionality, so that is safe
to execute an arbitrary script from your worst enemy without fear of
that script damaging the enclosing application or the rest of your
computing environment. In order to make an interpreter safe, certain
commands and variables are removed from the interpreter. For example,
commands to create files on disk are removed, and the **exec** command
is removed, since it could be used to cause damage through subprocesses.
Limited access to these facilities can be provided, by creating aliases
to the parent interpreter which check their arguments carefully and
provide restricted access to a safe subset of facilities. For example,
file creation might be allowed in a particular subdirectory and
subprocess invocation might be allowed for a carefully selected and
fixed set of programs.

A safe interpreter is created by specifying the **-safe** switch to the
**interp create** command. Furthermore, any child created by a safe
interpreter will also be safe.

A safe interpreter is created with exactly the following set of built-in
commands:

>
>     after	append	apply	array
>     binary	break	catch	chan
>     clock	close	concat	continue
>     dict	eof	error	eval
>     expr	fblocked	fcopy	fileevent
>     flush	for	foreach	format
>     gets	global	if	incr
>     info	interp	join	lappend
>     lassign	lindex	linsert	list
>     llength	lrange	lrepeat	lreplace
>     lsearch	lset	lsort	namespace
>     package	pid	proc	puts
>     read	regexp	regsub	rename
>     return	scan	seek	set
>     split	string	subst	switch
>     tell	time	trace	unset
>     update	uplevel	upvar	variable
>     vwait	while

The following commands are hidden by **interp create** when it creates a
safe interpreter:

>
>     cd	encoding	exec	exit
>     fconfigure	file	glob	load
>     open	pwd	socket	source
>     unload

These commands can be recreated later as Tcl procedures or aliases, or
re-exposed by **interp expose**.

The following commands from Tcl\'s library of support procedures are not
present in a safe interpreter:

>
>     auto_exec_ok	auto_import	auto_load
>     auto_load_index	auto_qualify	unknown

Note in particular that safe interpreters have no default **unknown**
command, so Tcl\'s default autoloading facilities are not available.
Autoload access to Tcl\'s commands that are normally autoloaded:

>
>     auto_mkindex	auto_mkindex_old
>     auto_reset	history
>     parray	pkg_mkIndex
>     ::pkg::create	::safe::interpAddToAccessPath
>     ::safe::interpCreate	::safe::interpConfigure
>     ::safe::interpDelete	::safe::interpFindInAccessPath
>     ::safe::interpInit	::safe::setLogCmd
>     tcl_endOfWord	tcl_findLibrary
>     tcl_startOfNextWord	tcl_startOfPreviousWord
>     tcl_wordBreakAfter	tcl_wordBreakBefore

can only be provided by explicit definition of an **unknown** command in
the safe interpreter. This will involve exposing the **source** command.
This is most easily accomplished by creating the safe interpreter with
Tcl\'s **Safe-Tcl** mechanism. **Safe-Tcl** provides safe versions of
**source**, **load**, and other Tcl commands needed to support
autoloading of commands and the loading of packages.

In addition, the **env** variable is not present in a safe interpreter,
so it cannot share environment variables with other interpreters. The
**env** variable poses a security risk, because users can store
sensitive information in an environment variable. For example, the PGP
manual recommends storing the PGP private key protection password in the
environment variable *PGPPASS*. Making this variable available to
untrusted code executing in a safe interpreter would incur a security
risk.

If extensions are loaded into a safe interpreter, they may also restrict
their own functionality to eliminate unsafe commands. For a discussion
of management of extensions for safety see the manual entries for
**Safe-Tcl** and the **load** Tcl command.

A safe interpreter may not alter the recursion limit of any interpreter,
including itself.

# ALIAS INVOCATION

The alias mechanism has been carefully designed so that it can be used
safely in an untrusted script which is being executed in a safe
interpreter even if the target of the alias is not a safe interpreter.
The most important thing in guaranteeing safety is to ensure that
information passed from the child to the parent is never evaluated or
substituted in the parent; if this were to occur, it would enable an
evil script in the child to invoke arbitrary functions in the parent,
which would compromise security.

When the source for an alias is invoked in the child interpreter, the
usual Tcl substitutions are performed when parsing that command. These
substitutions are carried out in the source interpreter just as they
would be for any other command invoked in that interpreter. The command
procedure for the source command takes its arguments and merges them
with the *targetCmd* and *arg*s for the alias to create a new array of
arguments. If the words of *srcCmd* were the new set of words will be
where *targetCmd* and *arg*s are the values supplied when the alias was
created. *TargetCmd* is then used to locate a command procedure in the
target interpreter, and that command procedure is invoked with the new
set of arguments. An error occurs if there is no command named
*targetCmd* in the target interpreter. No additional substitutions are
performed on the words: the target command procedure is invoked
directly, without going through the normal Tcl evaluation mechanism.
Substitutions are thus performed on each word exactly once: *targetCmd*
and *args* were substituted when parsing the command that created the
alias, and *arg1 - argN* are substituted when the alias\'s source
command is parsed in the source interpreter.

When writing the *targetCmd*s for aliases in safe interpreters, it is
very important that the arguments to that command never be evaluated or
substituted, since this would provide an escape mechanism whereby the
child interpreter could execute arbitrary code in the parent. This in
turn would compromise the security of the system.

# HIDDEN COMMANDS

Safe interpreters greatly restrict the functionality available to Tcl
programs executing within them. Allowing the untrusted Tcl program to
have direct access to this functionality is unsafe, because it can be
used for a variety of attacks on the environment. However, there are
times when there is a legitimate need to use the dangerous functionality
in the context of the safe interpreter. For example, sometimes a program
must be **source**d into the interpreter. Another example is Tk, where
windows are bound to the hierarchy of windows for a specific
interpreter; some potentially dangerous functions, e.g. window
management, must be performed on these windows within the interpreter
context.

The **interp** command provides a solution to this problem in the form
of *hidden commands*. Instead of removing the dangerous commands
entirely from a safe interpreter, these commands are hidden so they
become unavailable to Tcl scripts executing in the interpreter. However,
such hidden commands can be invoked by any trusted ancestor of the safe
interpreter, in the context of the safe interpreter, using **interp**
invoke. Hidden commands and exposed commands reside in separate name
spaces. It is possible to define a hidden command and an exposed command
by the same name within one interpreter.

Hidden commands in a child interpreter can be invoked in the body of
procedures called in the parent during alias invocation. For example, an
alias for **source** could be created in a child interpreter. When it is
invoked in the child interpreter, a procedure is called in the parent
interpreter to check that the operation is allowable (e.g. it asks to
source a file that the child interpreter is allowed to access). The
procedure then it invokes the hidden **source** command in the child
interpreter to actually source in the contents of the file. Note that
two commands named **source** exist in the child interpreter: the alias,
and the hidden command.

Because a parent interpreter may invoke a hidden command as part of
handling an alias invocation, great care must be taken to avoid
evaluating any arguments passed in through the alias invocation.
Otherwise, malicious child interpreters could cause a trusted parent
interpreter to execute dangerous commands on their behalf. See the
section on **ALIAS INVOCATION** for a more complete discussion of this
topic. To help avoid this problem, no substitutions or evaluations are
applied to arguments of **interp invokehidden**.

Safe interpreters are not allowed to invoke hidden commands in
themselves or in their descendants. This prevents them from gaining
access to hidden functionality in themselves or their descendants.

The set of hidden commands in an interpreter can be manipulated by a
trusted interpreter using **interp expose** and **interp hide**. The
**interp** expose command moves a hidden command to the set of exposed
commands in the interpreter identified by *path*, potentially renaming
the command in the process. If an exposed command by the targeted name
already exists, the operation fails. Similarly, **interp hide** moves an
exposed command to the set of hidden commands in that interpreter. Safe
interpreters are not allowed to move commands between the set of hidden
and exposed commands, in either themselves or their descendants.

Currently, the names of hidden commands cannot contain namespace
qualifiers, and you must first rename a command in a namespace to the
global namespace before you can hide it. Commands to be hidden by
**interp hide** are looked up in the global namespace even if the
current namespace is not the global one. This prevents children from
fooling a parent interpreter into hiding the wrong command, by making
the current namespace be different from the global one.

# RESOURCE LIMITS

Every interpreter has two kinds of resource limits that may be imposed
by any parent interpreter upon its children. Command limits (of type
**command**) restrict the total number of Tcl commands that may be
executed by an interpreter (as can be inspected via the **info
cmdcount** command), and time limits (of type **time**) place a limit by
which execution within the interpreter must complete. Note that time
limits are expressed as *absolute* times (as in **clock seconds**) and
not relative times (as in **after**) because they may be modified after
creation.

When a limit is exceeded for an interpreter, first any handler callbacks
defined by parent interpreters are called. If those callbacks increase
or remove the limit, execution within the (previously) limited
interpreter continues. If the limit is still in force, an error is
generated at that point and normal processing of errors within the
interpreter (by the **catch** command) is disabled, so the error
propagates outwards (building a stack-trace as it goes) to the point
where the limited interpreter was invoked (e.g. by **interp eval**)
where it becomes the responsibility of the calling code to catch and
handle.

## LIMIT OPTIONS

Every limit has a number of options associated with it, some of which
are common across all kinds of limits, and others of which are
particular to the kind of limit.

**-command**

:   This option (common for all limit types) specifies (if non-empty) a
    Tcl script to be executed in the global namespace of the interpreter
    reading and writing the option when the particular limit in the
    limited interpreter is exceeded. The callback may modify the limit
    on the interpreter if it wishes the limited interpreter to continue
    executing. If the callback generates an exception, it is reported
    through the background exception mechanism (see **BACKGROUND
    EXCEPTION HANDLING**). Note that the callbacks defined by one
    interpreter are completely isolated from the callbacks defined by
    another, and that the order in which those callbacks are called is
    undefined.

**-granularity**

:   This option (common for all limit types) specifies how frequently
    (out of the points when the Tcl interpreter is in a consistent state
    where limit checking is possible) that the limit is actually
    checked. This allows the tuning of how frequently a limit is
    checked, and hence how often the limit-checking overhead (which may
    be substantial in the case of time limits) is incurred.

**-milliseconds**

:   This option specifies the number of milliseconds after the moment
    defined in the **-seconds** option that the time limit will fire. It
    should only ever be specified in conjunction with the **-seconds**
    option (whether it was set previously or is being set this
    invocation.)

**-seconds**

:   This option specifies the number of seconds after the epoch (see
    **clock** seconds) that the time limit for the interpreter will be
    triggered. The limit will be triggered at the start of the second
    unless specified at a sub-second level using the **-milliseconds**
    option. This option may be the empty string, which indicates that a
    time limit is not set for the interpreter.

**-value**

:   This option specifies the number of commands that the interpreter
    may execute before triggering the command limit. This option may be
    the empty string, which indicates that a command limit is not set
    for the interpreter.

Where an interpreter with a resource limit set on it creates a child
interpreter, that child interpreter will have resource limits imposed on
it that are at least as restrictive as the limits on the creating parent
interpreter. If the parent interpreter of the limited parent wishes to
relax these conditions, it should hide the **interp** command in the
child and then use aliases and the **interp invokehidden** subcommand to
provide such access as it chooses to the **interp** command to the
limited parent as necessary.

# BACKGROUND EXCEPTION HANDLING

When an exception happens in a situation where it cannot be reported
directly up the stack (e.g. when processing events in an **update** or
**vwait** call) the exception is instead reported through the background
exception handling mechanism. Every interpreter has a background
exception handler registered; the default exception handler arranges for
the **bgerror** command in the interpreter\'s global namespace to be
called, but other exception handlers may be installed and process
background exceptions in substantially different ways.

A background exception handler consists of a non-empty list of words to
which will be appended two further words at invocation time. The first
word will be the interpreter result at time of the exception, typically
an error message, and the second will be the dictionary of return
options at the time of the exception. These are the same values that
**catch** can capture when it controls script evaluation in a
non-background situation. The resulting list will then be executed in
the interpreter\'s global namespace without further substitutions being
performed.

# EXAMPLES

Creating and using an alias for a command in the current interpreter:

    interp alias {} getIndex {} lsearch {alpha beta gamma delta}
    set idx [getIndex delta]

Executing an arbitrary command in a safe interpreter where every
invocation of **lappend** is logged:

    set i [interp create -safe]
    interp hide $i lappend
    interp alias $i lappend {} loggedLappend $i
    proc loggedLappend {i args} {
        puts "logged invocation of lappend $args"
        interp invokehidden $i lappend {*}$args
    }
    interp eval $i $someUntrustedScript

Setting a resource limit on an interpreter so that an infinite loop
terminates.

    set i [interp create]
    interp limit $i command -value 1000
    interp eval $i {
        set x 0
        while {1} {
            puts "Counting up... [incr x]"
        }
    }
