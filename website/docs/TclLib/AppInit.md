# NAME

Tcl_AppInit - perform application-specific initialization

# SYNOPSIS

**#include \<tcl.h\>**

int **Tcl_AppInit**(*interp*)

# ARGUMENTS

Interpreter for the application.

# DESCRIPTION

**Tcl_AppInit** is a procedure that is invoked by the main programs for
Tcl applications such as **tclsh** and **wish**. Its purpose is to allow
new Tcl applications to be created without modifying the main programs
provided as part of Tcl and Tk. To create a new application you write a
new version of **Tcl_AppInit** to replace the default version provided
by Tcl, then link your new **Tcl_AppInit** with the Tcl library.

**Tcl_AppInit** is invoked by **Tcl_Main** and **Tk_Main** after their
own initialization and before entering the main loop to process
commands. Here are some examples of things that **Tcl_AppInit** might
do:

\[1\]

:   Call initialization procedures for various packages used by the
    application. Each initialization procedure adds new commands to
    *interp* for its package and performs other package-specific
    initialization.

\[2\]

:   Process command-line arguments, which can be accessed from the Tcl
    variables **argv** and **argv0** in *interp*.

\[3\]

:   Invoke a startup script to initialize the application.

\[4\]

:   Use the routines **Tcl_SetStartupScript** and
    **Tcl_GetStartupScript** to set or query the file and encoding that
    the active **Tcl_Main** or **Tk_Main** routine will use as a startup
    script.

**Tcl_AppInit** returns **TCL_OK** or **TCL_ERROR**. If it returns
**TCL_ERROR** then it must leave an error message in for the
interpreter\'s result; otherwise the result is ignored.

In addition to **Tcl_AppInit**, your application should also contain a
procedure **main** that calls **Tcl_Main** as follows:

    Tcl_Main(argc, argv, Tcl_AppInit);

The third argument to **Tcl_Main** gives the address of the
application-specific initialization procedure to invoke. This means that
you do not have to use the name **Tcl_AppInit** for the procedure, but
in practice the name is nearly always **Tcl_AppInit** (in versions
before Tcl 7.4 the name **Tcl_AppInit** was implicit; there was no way
to specify the procedure explicitly). The best way to get started is to
make a copy of the file **tclAppInit.c** from the Tcl library or source
directory. It already contains a **main** procedure and a template for
**Tcl_AppInit** that you can modify for your application.
